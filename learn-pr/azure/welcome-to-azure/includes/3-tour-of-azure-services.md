- **Secure** through automatic encryption and role-based access control.
- **Scalable** with virtually unlimited storage.
- **Managed**, handling maintenance and any critical problems for you.
- **Accessible** from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS.

### Mobile

Azure enables developers to create mobile backend services for iOS, Android, and Windows apps quickly and easily. Features that used to take time and increase project risks, such as adding corporate sign-in and then connecting to on-premises resources such as SAP, Oracle, SQL Server, and SharePoint, are now simple to include.

Other features of this service include:
- Offline data synchronization.
- Connectivity to on-premises data.
- Broadcasting push notifications.
- Autoscaling to match business needs.

### Databases

Azure provides multiple database services to store a wide variety of data types and volumes. And with global connectivity, this data is available to users instantly.

> [!div class="mx-tableFixed"]
> | Service name | Service function |
> |--------------|------------------|
> | Azure Cosmos DB            | Globally distributed database that supports NoSQL options                                       |

### Internet of Things

People are able to access more information than ever before. It began with personal digital assistants (PDAs), then morphed into smartphones. Now there are smart watches, smart thermostats, even smart refrigerators. Personal computers used to be the norm. Now the internet allows any item that's online-capable to access valuable information. This ability for devices to garner and then relay information for data analysis is referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT).

There are a number of services that can assist and drive end-to-end solutions for IoT on Azure.

> [!div class="mx-tableFixed"]
> | Service Name | Description |
> |--------------|-------------|
> | IoT Central | Fully-managed global IoT software as a service (SaaS) solution that makes it easy to connect, monitor, and manage your IoT assets at scale |
> | Azure IoT Hub | Messaging hub that provides secure communications and monitoring between millions of IoT devices |
> | IoT Edge | Push your data analysis onto your IoT devices instead of in the cloud allowing them to react more quickly to state changes. 

### Big Data

Data comes in all formats and sizes. When we talk about Big Data, we're referring to _large_ volumes of data. Data from weather systems, communications systems, genomic research, imaging platforms, and many other scenarios generate hundreds of gigabytes of data. This amount of data makes it hard to analyze and make decisions around. It's often so large that traditional forms of processing and analysis are no longer appropriate.

Open source cluster technologies have been developed to deal with these large data sets. Microsoft Azure supports a broad range of technologies and services to provide big data and analytic solutions.

> [!div class="mx-tableFixed"]
> | Service Name | Description |
> |--------------|-------------|
> | Azure SQL Data Warehouse | Run analytics at a massive scale using a cloud-based Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) that leverages massive parallel processing (MPP) to run complex queries quickly across petabytes of data |
> | Azure HDInsight | Process massive amounts of data with managed clusters of Hadoop clusters in the cloud |
> | Azure Databricks (preview) | Collaborative Apache Sparkâ€“based analytics service that can be integrated with other Big Data services in Azure. |

### Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence, in the context of cloud computing, is based around a broad range of services, the core of which is Machine Learning. Machine Learning is a data science technique that allows computers to use existing data to forecast future behaviors, outcomes, and trends. Using machine learning, computers learn without being explicitly programmed.

Forecasts or predictions from machine learning can make apps and devices smarter. For example, when you shop online, machine learning helps recommend other products you might like based on what you've purchased. Or when your credit card is swiped, machine learning compares the transaction to a database of transactions and helps detect fraud. And when your robot vacuum cleaner vacuums a room, machine learning helps it decide whether the job is done.

Some of the most common Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning service types in Azure are:

> [!div class="mx-tableFixed"]
> | Service Name | Description |
> |--------------|-------------|
> | Azure Machine Learning Service | Cloud-based environment you can use to develop, train, test, deploy, manage, and track machine learning models. It can auto-generate a model and auto-tune it for you. It will let you start training on your local machine, and then scale out to the cloud |
> | Azure Machine Learning Studio | Collaborative, drag-and-drop visual workspace where you can build, test, and deploy machine learning solutions using pre-built machine learning algorithms and data-handling modules |

A closely related set of products are the _cognitive services_. These are pre-built APIs you can leverage in your applications to solve complex problems.

> [!div class="mx-tableFixed"]
> | Service Name | Description |
> |--------------|-------------|
> | Vision | Image-processing algorithms to smartly identify, caption, index, and moderate your pictures and videos. |
> | Speech | Convert spoken audio into text, use voice for verification, or add speaker recognition to your app. |
> | Knowledge mapping | Map complex information and data in order to solve tasks such as intelligent recommendations and semantic search. |
> | Bing Search | Add Bing Search APIs to your apps and harness the ability to comb billions of webpages, images, videos, and news with a single API call. |
> | Natural Language processing | Allow your apps to process natural language with pre-built scripts, evaluate sentiment and learn how to recognize what users want. |

### DevOps

DevOps (Development and Operations) brings together people, processes, and technology, automating software delivery to provide continuous value to your users. Azure DevOps Services allows you to create _build_ and _release_ pipelines that provide continuous integration, delivery, and deployment for your applications. You can integrate repositories and application tests, perform application monitoring, and work with build artifacts. You can also work with and backlog items for tracking, automate infrastructure deployment and integrate a range of third-party tools and services such as Jenkins and Chef. All of these functions and many more are closely integrated with Azure to allow for consistent, repeatable deployments for your applications to provide streamlined build and release processes.

Some of the main DevOps services available with Azure are Azure DevOps Services and Azure DevTest Labs.

> [!div class="mx-tableFixed"]
> | Service Name | Description |
> |--------------|-------------|
> | Azure DevOps | Azure DevOps Services (formerly known as Visual Studio Team Services, or VSTS), provides development collaboration tools including high-performance pipelines, free private Git repositories, configurable Kanban boards, and extensive automated and cloud-based load testing |
> | Azure DevTest Labs | Quickly create on-demand Windows and Linux environments you can use to test or demo your applications directly from your deployment pipelines |
