    - content: "The distance data must travel to reach its destination."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although distance can affect latency, latency does not measure distance."
    - content: "The time it takes for data to travel over the network."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Latency measures the time it takes for data to reach its destination. Latency is typically measured in milliseconds."
  - content: 'How does Azure Traffic Manager reduce latency?'
