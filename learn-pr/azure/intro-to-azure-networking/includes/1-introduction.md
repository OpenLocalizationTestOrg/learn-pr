You just started working at a startup that's fundamentally disrupting the vitamin industry with simple customization and affordable monthly subscriptions. While business is booming on the e-commerce site, your data center is starting to struggle to keep up with user demand. Your service fails when too many users sign in at the same time, and you're facing more scheduled and unscheduled maintenance windows than you'd like.

Your site is based in Silicon Valley, so you also find that a network delay is especially bad for users who are located in other regions, such as Europe and Asia. 

Therefore, you convince your team to move the site to the cloud to help save costs. But how can Azure, specifically, help your site run better?

As it turns out, managing networks on Azure isn't entirely different from managing on-premises networks. Let's discover why.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will learn:

- How an Azure virtual network provides secure network communication among resources such as virtual machines and other networks
- What high availability and resiliency mean and how Azure Load Balancer can increase resiliency within a single geographic region
- What latency is and how Traffic Manager helps reduce network latency and provides resiliency across geographic locations
