Microsoft offer previews of Azure features for evaluation purposes. With _Azure Preview Features_, you can test beta and other pre-release features, products, services, software, and regions.

Some of the common areas you will see previews for include:

- New storage types
- New Azure services, such as Machine Learning enhancements
- New or enhanced integration with other platforms
- New APIs for services

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure feature previews are available under certain terms and conditions that are specific to each particular Azure preview. Also, some previews are not covered by customer support.

Once a feature has been evaluated and tested successfully, it might be released to customers as part of Azure's default product set. This release is referred to as **General Availability** (GA). 

### Feature preview categories

There are two types of previews available:

- **Private Preview**. This means that an Azure feature is available to *specific* Azure customers for evaluation purposes. This is typically by invite only and issued directly by the product team responsible for the feature or service.
- **Public Preview**. This means that an Azure feature is available to *all* Azure customers for evaluation purposes. These previews can be turned on through the preview features page as detailed below.

### Finding preview features

You can learn about preview features through the [preview features page](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/preview/?azure-portal=true). This page lists the preview features that are available for evaluation. To access a preview feature, select its entry on this page and learn more about how to evaluate it. You can also use the **RSS Feed** button on this page to subscribe to notifications and stay informed.

You can also find Azure preview features in the portal as follows:

- Sign in to Azure portal.
- Select **Create a resource** in the resources panel to open the **New** blade.
- Enter the word *preview* into the search box at the top of the **New** blade.
- A list of available preview features is displayed, with the word **(preview)** next to each one.


## Azure portal preview features
Another preview area you can try is the next version of the Azure portal. Use the URL [https://preview.portal.azure.com](https://preview.portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true) (notice the **preview** prefix).

Typical portal preview features provide performance, navigation, and accessibility improvements to the Azure portal interface. It will be branded with an orange "Preview" banner, so you always know you are in the preview portal.

## Provide feedback on preview features
If you utilize the preview portal or a preview feature, Microsoft wants to hear about your experience. You can provide feedback through the "smiley" face icon on the portal or by posting ideas and suggestions on the Azure portal Feedback Forum.
