The Azure portal has several features and services available; let's look at some of the more common areas you'll tend to use. First, take a moment to hover your mouse pointer over each of the icons in the top menu bar for a few seconds each. You should see a tooltip label pop-up for each one. This is the name of the menu item. You will use these icons later.

## Services blade

1. In the left-hand pane, click **All services**. Take a couple of minutes to scroll down the list to see how many services Azure offers.

1. You can search for services through the _filter_ box.

1. Select **Virtual machines**. If you don't see it, use the filter box. The **Virtual Machines** blade appears. There is nothing currently showing because you have not defined any virtual machines.

1. Click the **+ Add** button. The **Create a virtual machine** blade appears, as in the previous exercise.

1. Click the **X** in the top right-hand corner to close the **Create a virtual machine** blade.

## Azure Cloud Shell

![Icon representing the Azure Cloud Shell](../media/5-cloud-shell-icon.png)

The Azure Cloud Shell allows you to use a command-line interface (CLI) to execute commands in your Azure subscription. You can access it by clicking the (`>_`) icon in the toolbar. However, it isn't available in the Sandbox environment - so you will only be able to do this in your own active subscriptions. You can also navigate to <https://shell.azure.com> to launch a Cloud Shell in the browser independent of the portal.

When you launch the shell, you will see a Welcome window. You can choose either a **Bash** or **PowerShell** environment, depending on your personal preferences. You can also change the shell at any time through the language drop-down on the left side of the shell.

Finally, there are a variety of management and programming tools included in the created environment.

- Azure command-line tools (Azure CLI, AzCopy, etc.)
- Languages / Frameworks including .NET Core, Python, and Java
- Container management support for Docker, Kubernetes, etc.
- Code editors such as vim, emacs, code, and nano
- Build tools (make, maven, npm, etc.)
- Database query tools such as `sqlcmd`

When enabled, you can use the mouse to cycle through the various color themes without opening this Settings menu by double-clicking the left mouse button in the Dashboard view's background area.
