Whether you're running a public facing application that handles massive amounts of traffic or an internal business API that manages critical data for internal systems, your users expect a system that performs well. Scaling your system to handle load, identifying network bottlenecks, and optimizing your storage performance are important to ensure your users have the best experience. In this module, we'll see how to make your application perform at its best.

As we learn about architecting our cloud solutions for performance and scalability, we'll see how one fictional Azure customer puts these principles to work. Lamna Healthcare is a national healthcare provider with several thousand physicians and clinicians across multiple facilities throughout the country. Their IT organization has recently undertaken an effort to reduce their datacenter footprint and move the majority of their IT systems to Azure. They have a mixture of in-house developed applications, open source, and off-the-shelf applications, with varying architectures and technology platforms. They want to make their journey to the cloud successful, and would like to learn what they need to focus on to help make it possible.

> [!NOTE]
> The concepts discussed in this module are not all-inclusive, but represent some of the important considerations when building a solution on the cloud. Microsoft publishes a broad set of patterns, guidelines, and examples on designing applications on Azure. It is highly recommended that you look through the content in the [Azure Architecture Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/) as you start planning and designing your architecture.
