  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Indexing all properties in a collection results in:"
    choices:
    - content: Higher-demand writes to the database and lower-demand queries.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: More resources are consumed when Azure Cosmos DB is updating the index. But using the index to find documents is more efficient.
    - content: Lower-demand writes to the database and higher-demand queries.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The opposite is true. The index needs to be updated whenever a document is written. Indexing all properties would make querying very efficient.
    - content: Higher-demand writes and queries.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Only the writes consume more RUs. You save on the required capacity for queries.
  - content: "For read-heavy workloads with an unknown query pattern, the best starting indexing strategy is:"
    choices: 
    - content: Set the indexing policy to `none`.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Having no properties indexed means that your read-heavy operations are less efficient.
    - content: Index all properties.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is a safe choice because you can perform queries efficiently. It's also the Azure Cosmos DB default."
    - content: Index only the specific properties that will be queried.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: In this case, you don't know ahead of time which properties will be queried.
    - content: Index only the `id` property of your documents.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This would save on the consumption of write operations. But because you have a read-heavy workload, this isn't a good choice."
