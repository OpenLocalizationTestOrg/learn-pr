There are many benefits to documenting the software that you build. Not only does solid documentation make your code more maintainable over time, it also makes it more consumable by others. Making your code more consumable is especially important when you have an API that others want to use. Thankfully, there are tools and frameworks available that reduce the cost of producing good documentation.

Suppose you're the lead developer for a print framing business. Your company decides to make its APIs publicly available. Many of the APIs have no existing documentation and it's your responsibility to document them. Documenting the APIs will make it easier for your partners to use them correctly, which will result in lower support and maintenance costs.

You need an easy and standardized way of documenting each API, and hosting the documentation in a location that is accessible for the partners.

In this module, you'll learn how to document an existing ASP.NET Core API using  Swagger/OpenAPI, Swashbuckle, and Swagger UI.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Learn about Swagger/Open API and Swashbuckle
- Enable Swagger for an C#/ASP.NET Core API
- Enable Swashbuckle for an C#/ASP.NET Core API
- Generate and view API documentation, with Swagger

## Prerequisites

- Experience with REST API design and implementation
- Experience developing basic ASP.NET Core apps
