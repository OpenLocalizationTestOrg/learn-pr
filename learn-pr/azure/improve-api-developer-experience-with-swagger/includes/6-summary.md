Providing rich documentation for an API makes it more consumable and easier to maintain. In the case of our framing business, we used Swashbuckle to auto-generate Swagger documentation for our ASP.NET Core API. Just adding Swashbuckle packages to our project gives us decent Swagger documentation that is easy to read and doesn't require the consumer to know the source code of the API. We then learned how to enhance the default documentation through XML comments and annotations.
