Let's install the Azure CLI on your local machine, and then run a command to verify your installation. The method you use for installing the Azure CLI depends on the operating system of your computer. Choose the steps for your operating system.

> [!NOTE]
> This exercise guides you through installing the Azure CLI tool locally. The remainder of the module will use the Azure Cloud Shell so you can leverage the free subscription support in Microsoft Learn. You can consider this exercise as an optional activity and just review the instructions if you prefer.

## Linux

Here you will install the Azure CLI on **Ubuntu Linux** using the Advanced Packaging Tool (**apt**) and the Bash command line.

> [!TIP]
> The commands listed below are for Ubuntu version 18.04. Other versions and distributions of Linux have different instructions. Follow the instructions in [Install the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) if you are using a different Linux version or have any problems.

1. Modify your sources list so that the Microsoft repository is registered, and the package manager can locate the Azure CLI package.

    ```bash
    AZ_REPO=$(lsb_release -cs)
    echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/azure-cli/ $AZ_REPO main" | \
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/azure-cli.list
    ```

1. Import the encryption key for the Microsoft Ubuntu repository. This will allow the package manager to verify that the Azure CLI package you install comes from Microsoft.

    ```bash
    curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | sudo apt-key add -
    ```

1. Install the Azure CLI.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install azure-cli
    ```

## macOS

Here you will install the Azure CLI on macOS using the Homebrew package manager.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the **brew** command is unavailable, you may need to install the Homebrew package manager. For details see the [Homebrew website](https://brew.sh/).

1. Update your brew repository to make sure you get the latest Azure CLI package.

    ```bash
    brew update
    ```

1. Install the Azure CLI.

    ```bash
    brew install azure-cli
    ```

::: zone pivot="windows"

## Windows

Here you will install the Azure CLI on Windows using the MSI installer.

1. Go to [https://aka.ms/installazurecliwindows](https://aka.ms/installazurecliwindows), and in the browser security dialog box, click **Run**.
1. In the installer, accept the license terms, and then click **Install**.
1. In the **User Account Control** dialog, select **Yes**.

## Running the Azure CLI

You run the Azure CLI by opening a bash shell (Linux and macOS), or from the command prompt or PowerShell (Windows).

1. Start the Azure CLI and verify your installation by running the version check.

    ```azurecli
    az --version
    ```

> [!TIP]
> Running the Azure CLI from PowerShell has some advantages over running the Azure CLI from the Windows command prompt. PowerShell provides additional tab completion features over those available from the command prompt.

::: zone-end

You set up your local machines to administer Azure resources with the Azure CLI. You can now use the Azure CLI locally to enter commands or execute scripts. The Azure CLI will forward your commands to the Azure datacenters where they will run inside your Azure subscription.
