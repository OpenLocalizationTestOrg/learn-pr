In this module, you learned the importance of having a tested backup and recovery strategy for your organization. You learned about the different types of Azure backups, and the reasons why you would choose one backup type versus another depending on your scenario.

You've seen that you can back up Azure virtual machines or on-premises machines. In addition, you learned how to perform a backup of an Azure VM, and then you restored it using the various options available to you, and you were able to monitor the progress.

You can now use Azure Backup to protect your environment against data loss or disk corruption, and restore services according to your Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery plan.
