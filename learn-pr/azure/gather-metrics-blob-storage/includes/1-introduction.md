You're the system administrator for a graphic design company. Your company creates large media files for online, broadcast, and print-based media, which are currently stored on servers in your datacenter. The data is heavily compressed before being downloaded by clients via FTP for review. You plan to move all the files for collaboration or review into Azure Blob Storage, and provide clients with direct access, thereby saving time and effort, and enabling clients to review and retrieve their files more easily.

Azure blob storage containers enable you to store massive amounts of unstructured data in Azure, which might include images, distributed files, streaming video, or audio. You can also use blob storage to store log files, backup data, and data for analysis, either on-premises or by using an Azure-hosted service. 

Monitoring is also essential for controlling the costs of Azure storage, which will ensure your organization can effectively manage its use of storage. Consider that over time you might want to identify the demand on the platform to ensure clients can retrieve files efficiently with little lag or delay. You'll also want to be able to use log information to troubleshoot issues, such as if a client cannot access a certain file. In this module, you will see how to monitor Azure Blob Storage to ensure that you get the desired results from this feature. 

Note that this module deals with Azure Storage Analytics and its use in the portal. No developer subjects are included. A separate module covers how to use the Azure SDK and the Azure Monitor REST API to access Azure Storage Analytics (ASA) data.
