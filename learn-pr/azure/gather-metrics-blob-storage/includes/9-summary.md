In this module, you viewed Blob storage metric information in the Azure portal. You then created custom dashboards in the Azure portal, and retrieved Storage Analytics logs from Azure.

**More information**

Blob storage supports Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. For more information, see Introduction to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 Preview, at https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction.

Transaction metrics are sent to Azure Monitor every minute, and are available both for the account and service. For more information, see Storage Metrics in Azure Monitor, at https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-metrics-in-azure-monitor.

You can also specify custom metrics. For more information, see Custom metrics in Azure Monitor, at https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/metrics-custom-overview.

Shared dashboards are an Azure resource, which means you can share them by using Azure Role Based Access Control (RBAC). RBAC in Azure enables you to apply roles to different Azure user accounts or groups so those users or groups can access a resource or resource group. You can apply different roles to different users or groups so that some users might only be able to view a resource, but other users could manage a resource.
