In this module, you created a new ASP.NET web app from scratch and then published it to Azure directly from Visual Studio. We created an App Service app, updated our app, and published changes, without ever leaving Visual Studio.

Visual Studio and Azure App Service provide a powerful mechanism for creating, publishing, and maintaining web apps in Azure. With this combination of simplicity and manageability, keeping web apps up-to-date in Azure becomes a simple process.
