  title: Check your knowledge. For all of the scenarios listed below, choose the API that best supports the requirements.
  questions:

  - content: "The e-commerce application has a requirement to support a shopping basket. Customers can add and remove products, and any discounts (like buy one get one free) need to be kept in the basket. The sales team wants the flexibility to offer different kinds of discounts, and to add or remove different product categories."
    choices:
    - content: "Core (SQL)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This type of data is modeled best by documents. Core (SQL) is the best choice for a new system."
    - content: "MongoDB"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "MongoDB might be a good second choice due to the document nature, but Core (SQL) is the best choice as there is no need to support existing MongoDB data or an existing application."
    - content: "Cassandra"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "There isn't a fixed schema, and this isn't a good fit as flexibility is needed."
    - content: "Azure Table Storage"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This isn't a simple key-value pair."
    - content: "Gremlin (graph)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "There is no requirement to store relationships or metadata on those links between items."
    

  - content: "The risk department has asked if the new project could implement some form of fraud detection and prevention. The guidance is that the fraud system would need to be able to track the relationship between customers, payment types, billing and delivery addresses, IP address, geolocation, and past purchase history. Anything that doesn't fit into normal behavior should be flagged."
    choices:
    - content: "Core (SQL)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Complex relationships, and needed to store metadata against them is best supported by a graph mode of data."
    - content: "MongoDB"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Complex relationships, and needed to store metadata against them is best supported by a graph mode of data."
    - content: "Cassandra"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Complex relationships, and needed to store metadata against them is best supported by a graph mode of data."
    - content: "Azure Table Storage"

    choices:
    - content: "Core (SQL)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The need to reuse existing CQL queries means that Cassandra is the best choice for in this scenario. Core (SQL) would be a good second choice for this scenario."
