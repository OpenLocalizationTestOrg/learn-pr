quiz:
  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: 'Which of the next items is the best candidate for a reserved instance?'
    choices:
    - content: 'A web application deployed on Azure App Service.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Azure App Service is a PaaS service, reserved instances are a feature for select compute services.'
    - content: 'A non-production virtual machine that is automatically shut down in off-hours when not in use.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Since this virtual machine won''t run the majority of the time it won''t fully use the instance reservation, and isn''t a good candidate for a reserved instance.'
    - content: 'An ExpressRoute circuit.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'ExpressRoute is a network service, reserved instances are a feature for select compute services.'
    - content: 'A database server for an HR system for a global business.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Because of the criticality and global nature of this system, it''s likely that it would be running the majority of the time, making it a great candidate for a reserved instance.'

  - content: 'When do compute costs associated with a VM stop accruing?'
    choices:
    - content: 'When you shut down the virtual machine from inside the OS'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'If you shut down the OS of the virtual machine, it''s still allocated on the Azure platform and will continue to accrue compute costs.'
    - content: 'When you click the Stop button in the Azure portal.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Clicking the Stop button will deallocate the virtual machine from the Azure platform and it will no longer accrue compute costs.'
