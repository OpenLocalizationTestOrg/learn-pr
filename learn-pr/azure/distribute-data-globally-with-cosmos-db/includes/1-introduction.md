Sending a packet across the world under ideal network conditions takes hundreds of milliseconds. The only way to cheat the speed of light is to place data locally, so that it has less distance to travel.

Imagine you work at an online clothing retailer, with large customer populations in Los Angeles, New York, and Tokyo. By replicating your data in multiple data-centers around the world, closest to where your users are, you ensure they all have the fastest access to your products, so you don't lose out to competitors.

## Learning objective

In this module, you will:

* Learn about the benefits of writing and replicating data to multiple regions around the world
* Change the read and write priorities for the regions in which your data is located
* Change the consistency setting for your database
