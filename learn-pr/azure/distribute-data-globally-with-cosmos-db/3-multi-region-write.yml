  questions:

  - content: 'True or false: the benefits of writing to multiple regions are decreased latency, unlimited scaling potential, and improved availability.'
    choices:
    - content: "True"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Writing to multiple regions has many performance benefits. For example, the latency for write operations is less than in non-multi-master accounts."
    - content: "False"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Writing to multiple regions has many performance benefits. For example, the latency for write operations is less than in non-multi-master accounts."
  - content: 'What is the default conflict-resolution policy in a multi-master account?'
    choices:
    - content: "Last-Writer-Wins"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Conflict resolution is built-in to Azure Cosmos DB and is performed on the server, inside the database engine. Last-Writer-Wins is the default policy."
    - content: "A custom user-defined procedure"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "User-defined procedures are supported, but they are not the default mechanism for handling conflicts."
