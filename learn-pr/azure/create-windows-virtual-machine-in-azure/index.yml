  title: Create a Windows virtual machine in Azure
  description: Azure virtual machines (VMs) enable you to create dedicated compute resources in minutes that can be used just like a physical desktop or server machine. Whether your virtual machine is a server that you connect to for administration purposes, or a virtual workstation for an end user, the remote desktop protocol (RDP) gives the same experience as sitting at the terminal of a local physical computer.
