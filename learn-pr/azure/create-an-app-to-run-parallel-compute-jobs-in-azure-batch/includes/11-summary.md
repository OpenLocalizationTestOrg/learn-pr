Azure Batch service is useful in cases when you need to execute compute intensive jobs in parallel.

You've learnt how you can use different libraries to integrate Azure Batch and Azure Storage inside a .NET Core console application.

In the exercises, you've seen how applications like  **FFmpeg** are added as application packages and then executed in parallel on nodes in a pool.

## Clean up

When working in your own subscription, it is best practice at the end of a module to decide whether or not you still need the resources you created. Resources left running can cost you money. You can delete resources one by one, or delete the resource group that holds the resources to delete the entire set.
