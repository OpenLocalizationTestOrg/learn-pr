Logging and monitoring the health of your services is a vital component of production applications. You need to be able to determine the causes, failures, and identify any problems before they occur.

Azure Monitor is an important tool to help you in this process. It enables you to gather monitoring and diagnostic information about the health of your services. You can use this information to visualize and analyze the causes of problems that might occur in your app.

Suppose that you work for the operations team of a large organization. The organization is running a number of large-scale production apps in the cloud. The operations team would like to consolidate their log data in a single service to improve visibility across services and simplify their logging strategy. They've begun implementing Azure Monitor logs and would like to get a full understanding of how it works, and what the capabilities are to query and evaluate the log data being fed into the service.
