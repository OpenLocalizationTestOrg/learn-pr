Imagine you're managing storage for an online retailer. You need tools to create, update, and delete your user and product data.

In this module, you will build a .NET Core console application in Visual Studio Code to create, update, and delete user records, query your data, and perform stored procedures using C#.

Your data will be stored in Azure Cosmos DB, which has a convenient Visual Studio Code extension so you can easily create an Azure Cosmos DB account, database, and collection, and copy your connection string into the app without having to open the Azure portal.
