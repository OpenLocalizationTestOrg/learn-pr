SQL database elastic pools are a cost-effective service that can manage and scale multiple Azure SQL databases that have varying and unpredictable resource requirements. 

Imagine you work for an innovative fitness company that uses Azure Cognitive Services to visually analyze hundreds of physical attributes and metrics of your customers. Customers come to your location to workout, and you use the intelligent systems to track their fitness progress and make health recommendations every time they visit. You designed your system to store customer data in an Azure SQL database. 

The business became successful. As the business grew, franchises were sold globally and there are now thousands of locations. However, your company continues to develop, maintain, and run the intelligent systems. What started as gym has become a software as a service (SaaS) company. You now need to maintain and scale separate Azure SQL databases for each location. However the data resource requirements for each location are unique, some serve larger areas than others, and they run promotions at different times of year. As result, the rates of growth vary and load is unpredictable. 

In this module, you'll learn how to use SQL Elastic pools to scale, manage performance, and manage costs for collections of Azure SQL databases.
