## Eligibility criteria

Azure Government is available exclusively to three distinct types of customers:

- A US government entity in its governmental capacity, such as a federal agency, state/local entity, regional or interstate government entity, or federally funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC).
- A partner using Azure Government to provide a solution that provides services or solutions to US government customers through direct or indirect contracts or serves US government customers through GSA or other contract vehicles.
- A commercial entity with data subject to government regulations. Accepted government data types include: International Traffic in Arms (ITAR), Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), Department of Defense (DoD) Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information (UCNI), Department of Energy (DoE) UCNI, Criminal Justice Information (CJI), Department of Defense Impact Level Data, and other types of data that require Azure Government

Proof of membership in one of the groups listed above is required for access to Azure Government. An international commercial entity with data regulated by the US government may qualify, though the entity may be required to purchase the service through their US subsidiary.

## Test Azure Government with a 90-day free trial

The Azure Government 90-day trial includes $500 per month to spend on Azure Government services. This trial is a non-renewable, fixed-term, agreement. Customers and partners who wish to continue using Azure Government after 90 days or after the $500 limit is exceeded need an Enterprise Agreement or a Pay-As-You-Go subscription.

Request your trial online at [https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/government/request/?ReqType=Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/government/request/?ReqType=Trial).

## Options for purchasing Azure Government

Many large organizations have multiple cloud licenses with multiple providers, and you may choose multiple options to optimize price, flexibility, and service availability.

### Pay-As-You-Go subscriptions

With a Pay-As-You-Go subscription, you pay only for what you use with no minimums, scaling up or down on the fly. Pay with a credit card with easy monthly billing or invoicing and cancel anytime. To get started, request a trial. When you&#39;re ready, you can add a credit card to your account. Customers choosing a Pay-As-You-Go subscription for Azure Government gain the benefits of immediate and direct billing with no monetary commitment. Pay-As-You-Go subscriptions receive the same service level agreement (SLA) as other license types, but do not include the benefits of the Azure Enterprise Portal or the value-added services that partners can provide. You can set up multiple billing containers/separate accounts to help your agency manage spending across cost centers.

### Purchasing through a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP)

 With a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP), you benefit from a partner who can build custom solutions on Azure Government and provide a single bill for both your Azure Government usage and any additional value-added services. The CSP program is a great fit for the US public sector where partners already build, deploy, and manage solutions on behalf of federal, state, local, and tribal entities. You can find a current list of Azure Government CSPs at [https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-government/documentation-government-csp-list](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-government/documentation-government-csp-list).

Customers choosing to purchase Azure Government through a CSP gain the added value of a service provider who understands government requirements and can help you plan, build, deploy, and manage solutions. CSPs can help you navigate the purchasing process and may provide flexibility on billing that better aligns to your reporting needs.

If you are already working with a CSP, this channel may minimize the need for a net new procurement process. In addition, many of the CSPs in the list above offer customized support options for government customers. You can find a current list of available services through the CSP program at [https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-solution-provider/overview/azure-csp-available-services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-solution-provider/overview/azure-csp-available-services).

If any of the following requirements apply to your organization or if you have additional questions, contact us to discuss your needs:

- If you are subject to regulatory requirements such as ITAR, CJIS, DFARS, or IRS 1075
- If you are currently an Enterprise Agreement customer interested in moving to CSP
- If you are interested in purchasing Microsoft Cloud products other than Azure

## Acquiring an Enterprise Agreement

With an Enterprise Agreement for Azure Government, you gain several licensing benefits, including: the broadest set of services, support for multi-tenant solutions, and access to the Azure Enterprise Portal. The Enterprise Portal is a great resource for customers managing multiple accounts or subscriptions. These licensing benefits differ from what is available through a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP). Enterprise Agreements are also a good choice for customers with specific business requirements for this type of license. If you have an existing Enterprise Agreement and want to add an Azure Government subscription, you simply need to execute a Microsoft Cloud for Government enrollment to your existing agreement.

Contact your Microsoft representative to learn more. If you are interested in purchasing Azure Government through a new Enterprise Agreement, contact an Azure Government Licensing Solution Provider (LSP). Find a list at [https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/azure-government/](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/azure-government/). Licensing Solution Providers can help you acquire your license. LSPs do not generally provide the same in-depth ongoing support as a CSP.
