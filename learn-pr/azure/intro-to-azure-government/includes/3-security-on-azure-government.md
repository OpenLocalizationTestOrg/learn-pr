Customers are assured of high levels of security because Azure Government:

- Provides a separate instance of Microsoft Azure that offers geo-replication
- Requires a US entity, US Government affiliation, or government-controlled data requirement to qualify
- Supports disaster recovery scenarios with geographically distributed data centers
- Built to exceed the highest compliance standards 

Azure Government covers over 72 compliance regimes – the broadest and most comprehensive compliance in the industry. 

## Azure Government: Layered Datacenter Security

Azure Government's defense-in-depth approach to physical security provides multiple levels of protection, as shown in the following diagram. 

![Summary of layered datacenter security approach](../media/layered-datacenter-security.png)

- **Access approval** is comprehensive, ensuring that only individuals on a pre-authorized list can enter Azure Government datacenters. Personnel are granted access to discrete areas only as it’s truly needed, following a “least privileged access” principle. We also have clear separation of duties between datacenter management and security personnel; which provides additional operational assurance.
- **Perimeter** security starts with fencing, front entrance gates, and camera monitory. Every datacenter has one defined access point as well as on-going roaming patrols. 
- **Building** security features 24x7x365 security operations, two-factor authentication with biometrics, and verified single person entry. Buildings are not Microsoft-branded and have extensive camera coverage, and camera monitoring 24x7x365 in addition to on-going roaming patrols. The comprehensive access approval process ensures that only individuals on a pre-authorized list can enter our datacenters. Personnel are granted access to discrete areas only as it’s truly needed, following a “least privileged access” principle. There's also a clear separation of duties between datacenter management and security personnel; which provides additional operational assurance.
- **Server environment** access is restricted according to internal personnel access needs. Operational procedures prevent bringing or removing unapproved data-bearing devices. Additional security screening, including metal detectors, biometric two-factor authentication, video monitoring, and on-going roaming patrols further secure server rooms. 

## Data Security
Azure Government offers a variety of services to help secure data:

**Azure Security Center** and **Microsoft Intelligent Graph** leverage advanced analytics so you can learn from and mitigate evolving attacks.

**Key Vault** encrypts keys and secrets in FIPS 140-2 validated hardware security modules, provisions and centrally manages keys in seconds, and audits for further analysis and threat detection.

**Azure Active Directory (AAD)** controls permissions and access efficiently. This comprehensive identity and access management cloud solution provides a robust set of capabilities to manage users and groups. It helps secure access to on-premises and cloud applications. It manages user identities and creates intelligence-driven access policies to secure resources. It provides one consistent sign-on experience across Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS devices. Azure Multi-Factor Authentication prevents unauthorized access to both on-premises and cloud applications by providing an additional level of authentication. You can protect your business and mitigate potential threats with security monitoring and alerts and machine learning-based reports that identify inconsistent access patterns.

Geographically distributed datacenters, built-in replication services, and **Azure Site Recovery**, and **Backup** support disaster recovery scenarios and ensure business continuity.
