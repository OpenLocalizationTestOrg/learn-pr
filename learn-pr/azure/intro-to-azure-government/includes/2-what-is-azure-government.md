Azure Government is a cloud environment specifically built to meet compliance and security requirements for US government. This mission-critical cloud delivers  breakthrough innovation to U.S. government customers and their partners. Azure Government applies to government at any level â€” from state and local governments to federal agencies including Department of Defense agencies. 

While there are multiple cloud providers in the public sector, not many can offer the unique capabilities required by state and local and federal government agencies. Azure Government provides hybrid flexibility, deep security, and broad compliance coverage across regulatory standards.

The key difference between Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Azure Government is that Azure Government is a sovereign cloud. It's a physically separated instance of Azure, dedicated to U.S. government workloads only. It's built exclusively for government agencies and their solution providers.

Azure Government is designed for highly sensitive data, enabling government customers to safely transfer mission-critical workloads to the cloud.
