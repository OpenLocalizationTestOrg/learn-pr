    - content: "Build container images without the need for locally installed Docker tools."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Container images can be built in the cloud using Azure Container Registry Build."
  
  - content: "What is the recommended authentication method for Azure Container Registry?"
    choices:
    - content: "Admin account"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "An admin account can be created for Azure Container Registry; however, this is not the recommended authentication method."
    - content: "Username and password"

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Container Registry is a private registry and cannot be accessed without authentication."
 
  - content: "Suppose you use container images to run compute workloads in multiple regions throughout the world. You plan to enable the geo-replication feature of Azure Container Registry to decrease the time required to provision an instance. Which regions should you choose for your replicas when configuring geo-replication?"
    choices:
    - content: "Place a container registry in the region closest to your development team."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The goal is to place the registries close to the execution locations, not near the development team."
    - content: "Place a container registry in each region where images are run."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Placing a registry in each region that runs the images will ensure network-close registry access everywhere it is needed."
    - content: "Place a container registry in every Azure region."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This will increase costs but will not increase performance."
