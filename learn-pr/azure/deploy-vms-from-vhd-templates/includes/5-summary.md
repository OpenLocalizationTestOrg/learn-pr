In this module you've learned about customized virtual machine images and how you can use them to deploy virtual machines. You saw how to:

- Create a specialized virtual hard disk
- Create a virtual machine from an existing managed disk
- Create a virtual machine image
- Create a virtual machine from an existing virtual machine image

You can use this knowledge to build a customized virtual machine image configured to meet your organization's requirements. You can then use this image to roll out virtual machines across the entire organization.
