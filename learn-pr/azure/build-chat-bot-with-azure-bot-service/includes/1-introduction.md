The Azure Bot Service, combined with Microsoft QnA Maker, provides the tools developers need to build and publish intelligent bots that interact naturally with users through a range of services. 

In this module, you will create a bot using the Azure Bot Service and connect it to a knowledge base built with QnA Maker. Then, you will interact with the bot using the Microsoft QnA Maker and Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator.
