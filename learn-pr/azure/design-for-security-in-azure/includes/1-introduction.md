Security is one of the most important aspects of any architecture. Ensuring that your business data and customer data are secure is critical. A public data breach can ruin a company's reputation as well as cause significant personal and financial harm. In this module, weâ€™ll discuss key architectural security considerations as you design an environment on the cloud.

As we learn about architecting our cloud solutions with security as a primary consideration, we'll see how one fictional Azure customer puts these principles to work:

Lamna Healthcare is a national healthcare provider. Their IT organization has recently started to move the majority of their IT systems to Azure. They have a mixture of custom apps, open-source apps, and off-the-shelf applications, with varying architectures and technology platforms. We'll learn what they need to do to migrate to the cloud while keeping their systems and data secure.

> [!NOTE]
> The concepts discussed in this module are not all-inclusive, but represent some of the important considerations when building a solution on the cloud. Microsoft publishes a broad set of patterns, guidelines, and examples on designing applications on Azure. It is highly recommended that you look through the content in the [Azure Architecture Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/) as you start planning and designing your architecture.
