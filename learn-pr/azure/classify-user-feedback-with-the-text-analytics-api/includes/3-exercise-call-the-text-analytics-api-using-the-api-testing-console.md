To see the Text Analytics API in action, let's make some calls using the built-in API testing console tool located in the online reference documentation. Before we do that, we'll need an access key to make those calls.

[!include[](../../../includes/azure-sandbox-activate.md)]

## Create an access key

Every call to Text Analytics API requires a subscription key. Often called an access key, it is used to validate that you have access to make the call. We'll use the Azure portal to grab a key.

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true) using the same account you activated the sandbox with.

1. Click **Create a resource**.

1. In the **Search the Marketplace** search box, type in *text analytics* and hit return.

1. Select **Text Analytics** in the search results and then select the **Create** button in the bottom right of the screen.

1. In the **Create** page that opens, enter the following values into each field.

    |Property  | Value  | Description  |
    |---------|---------|---------|
    |Name     |    *Choose a unique name*     |  The name of the Cognitive Services account. We recommend using a descriptive name. Valid characters are `a-z`, `0-9`, and `-`.    |
    |Subscription     |  Concierge Subscription    |   The subscription under which this new Cognitive Services API account with **Text Analytics API** is created.      |
    |Location     |  *Choose a region from the dropdown*       |  Select a location from the dropdown.  |
    |Pricing tier     | **F0 Free**     |   The cost of your Cognitive Services account depends on the actual usage and the options you choose. We recommend selecting the free tier for our purposes here.      |
    |Resource group     |  Select **Use existing** and choose <rgn>[sandbox resource group name]</rgn>       |  Name for the new resource group in which to create your Cognitive Services Text Analytics API account.       |

    > [!TIP]
    > Remember the location you selected when creating the Text Analytics cognitive services account. You'll use it to make API calls shortly. 

1. Select **Create** at the bottom of the page to start the account creation process. Watch for a notification that the deployment is in progress. You'll then get a notification that the account has been deployed successfully to your resource group.

## Get the access key

Now that we have our Cognitive Services account, let's find the access key so we can start calling the API.

1. Click on the **Go to resource** button on the *Deployment succeeded* notification. This action opens the account Quickstart.

1. Select the **Keys** menu item from the menu on the left, or in the *Grab your keys* section of the quickstart. This action opens the **Manage keys** page.

1. Copy one of the keys using the copy button.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Always keep your access keys safe and never share them.

1. Store this key for the rest of this module. We'll use it shortly to make API calls from the testing console and throughout the rest of the module.

## Call the API from the testing console

Now that we have our key, we can head over to the testing console and take the API for a spin.

1. Navigate to the following URL in your favorite browser. Replace `[location]` with the location you selected when creating the Text Analytics cognitive services account earlier in this unit. For example, if you created the account in *eastus*, you'd replace `[location]` with `eastus` in the URL.

    ```bash
    https://[location].dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/TextAnalytics.V2.0
    ```

    The landing page displays a menu on the left and content to the right. The menu lists the POST methods you can call on the Text Analytics API. These endpoints are **Detect Language**, **Entities**, **Key Phrases**, and **Sentiment**. To call one of these operations, we need to do a few things.

    - Select the method we want to call.
    - Add the access key that we saved earlier in the lesson to each call.

1. From the left menu, select **Sentiment**. This selection opens the Sentiment documentation to the right. As the documentation shows, we'll be making a REST call in the following format.  

    `https://[location].api.cognitive.microsoft.com/text/analytics/v2.0/sentiment`

     `[location]` is replaced with the location that you selected when you created the Text Analytics account.  
We'll pass in our subscription key, or access key, in the **ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key** header.

## Make some API calls

1. In the **Open API testing console** section of this page, select the button corresponding to the location or region in which you created  the Cognitive Services account. Selecting this button opens the live, interactive, API console.

1. Paste the access key you saved earlier into the field labeled **Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key**. Notice that the key is written automatically into the HTTP request window as a header value.

1. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Send**.

    Let's examine the sections of this screen in more detail.

    In the Headers section of the user interface, we set the access, or subscription, key in the header of our request.

    ![Screenshot of headers section.](../media/2-marker.PNG)

    Next, we have the request body section, which holds a **documents** array. Each document in the array has three properties. The properties are *"language"*, *"id"*, and *"text"*. The *"id"* is a number in this example, but it can be anything you want as long as it's unique in the documents array. In this example, we're also passing in documents written in three different languages. Over 15 languages are supported in the Sentiment feature of the Text Analytics API. For more information, check out [Supported languages in the Text Analytics API](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/text-analytics-supported-languages). The maximum size of a single document is 5,000 characters, and one request can have up to 1,000 documents.

    ![Screenshot of Request Body section](../media/3-marker.PNG)

    The complete request, including the headers and the request URL are displayed in the next section. In this example, you can see that the requests are routed to a URL that begins with `westus`. The URL differs depending on the location you selected when you created your Text Analytics account.

    ![Screenshot of section number four showing the request URL.](../media/4-marker.PNG)
    ![Screenshot of the section number five showing detailed HTTP request.](../media/5-marker.PNG)

    Then we have information about the response. In the example, we see that the request was a success and code `200` was returned.

    ![Screenshot of section number five showing the response status](../media/6-marker.PNG)

    Finally, we see the response to our request. The response holds the insight the Text Analytics API had about our documents. An array of documents is returned to us, without the original text. We get back an *"id"* and *"score"* for each document. The API returns a numeric score between 0 and 1. Scores close to 1 indicate positive sentiment, while scores close to 0 indicate negative sentiment. A score of 0.5 indicates the lack of sentiment, a neutral statement. In this example, we have two pretty positive documents and one negative document.

Congratulations! You've made your first call to the Text Analytics API without writing a line of code. Feel free to stay in the console and try out more calls. Here are some suggestions:

- Change the documents in section number 2 and see what the API returns.
- Try the other methods, **Detect Language**, **Entities**, and **Key Phrases**, using the same subscription key.
- Try to make a call from a different region with your subscription and observe what happens.

The API testing console is a great way to explore the capabilities of this API. Now that you've explored for yourself, let's move on to putting this intelligence into a real-world scenario.
