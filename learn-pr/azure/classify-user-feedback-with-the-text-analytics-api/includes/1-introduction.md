If I showed you text written in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS, what emotions would it convey? If a book review I wrote claims that "the ending was unpredictable," is that statement a good or bad thing? How can I find out programmatically what language an email was written in? Text Analytics is about understanding and analyzing unstructured text to answer these kinds of questions. It covers sentiment analysis, key phrase extraction, language detection, and more.

 In this module, we're going to focus our attention on sentiment analysis. We'll learn about the Text Analytics API. This cloud-based service from Microsoft provides advanced natural language processing (NLP) over raw text. When you've completed the module, you'll have built a solution with Azure Functions that sorts text feedback based on sentiment.

## Learning objectives  

In this module, you will:

- Learn about Text Analytics API
- Sign up for a Text Analytics API key
- Design and build a service with Azure Functions that uses the Text Analytics API to sort text feedback
- Read and write Azure Queue storage messages in a function app with the help of bindings
