  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Deploying an app can be done directly to what level of physical granularity?"
    choices:
    - content: 'Region'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Azure organizes infrastructure around _regions_, which include multiple datacenters. You can pick the region you want resources deployed into. You can't select a specific datacenter or location within a datacenter."
    - content: 'Datacenter'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure organizes infrastructure around _regions_, which include multiple datacenters."
    - content: 'Server rack'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure organizes infrastructure around _regions_, which include multiple datacenters. You can't select a specific datacenter or location within a datacenter."
  - content: "To use Azure datacenters that are made available with power, cooling, and networking capabilities independent from other datacenters in a region, choose a region that supports _________?"
    choices:
    - content: 'Geography distribution'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Distributing your resources geographically can improve latency for globally distributed users, but regions are generally specific to a geographic area. Availability Zones are a collection of independently equipped data centers."
    - content: 'Service-Level Agreements (SLAs)'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Service-Level Agreements are specific to Azure products and services, not to regions. Availability Zones are a collection of independently equipped data centers."
    - content: 'Availability Zones'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Availability Zones are datacenters set up to be an isolation boundary from others in the region, with their own power, cooling, and networking. If one zone in a region goes down, other Availability Zones in the region continue to work."
  - content: "Application availability refers to what?"
    choices:
      - content: "The service level agreement of the associated resource."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The service level agreement gives you a guarantee of the availability of the resource, not of the application itself."
      - content: "Application support for an availability zone."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Only the underlying resources used in the application support availability zones."
      - content: "The overall time that a system is functional and working."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. The time that a system is working is referred to as the application availability."
