Suppose you are the lead Web developer for an online fashion site based on Azure Web apps. The company is rolling out a major rebranding and is using this as an opportunity to bring new purchasing, tracking, and social media features to the company's online presence. The company has won several prestigious and influential industry and consumer awards for the high standard of its current online customer experience, so it is essential that when the new apps go live, there no unexpected performance or functionality issues. You have an app in development and, during this early stage of the dev cycle, you want a simple and easy way to capture basic application logging output without the need for a specialized SDK such as Azure Application Insights.

In this module, you will enable application logging to record traces in your web applications. You will enable logging, monitor a live log stream, and retrieve logs from Azure.
