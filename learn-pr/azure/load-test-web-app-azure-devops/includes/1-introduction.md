Imagine you're a lead web developer at a costume rental company. You launched in one city several months ago and are planning to expand into more regions. You're developing a new web application to support this expansion and want to understand its behavior under load. You have some basic data from your initial launch. You now want to verify that your new application can meet performance targets for the peak traffic that you expect, based on your initial data.

In this module, you'll learn how to create a load test in the Azure portal, run it and check the results, and then customize the test in Azure DevOps.

## Prerequisites

- Understand how to build basic websites.
- Know how to navigate resources in the Azure portal.
- Understand how web servers deliver pages to browsers by using the HTTP protocol.
