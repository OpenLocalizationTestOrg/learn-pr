  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
    - content: "What is the main benefit of using a network virtual appliance?"
      choices:
      - content: "To enable outbound access to the internet"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This answer is incorrect. A network virtual appliance doesn't control outbound internet access. This can be controlled by policies"
      - content: "To load balance incoming traffic from the internet across multiple Azure VMs across two regions for DR purposes"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This answer is incorrect. Network virtual appliance doesn't load balance traffic across VMs for DR purposes. This is the role of Application Gateways and Traffic Manager"
      - content: "To control incoming traffic from the perimeter network, and only allowing traffic that meets security requirements to pass through"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "This is the correct answer. A network virtual appliance acts like a firewall and checks all inbound and outbound traffic, and either allows or denies the traffic to secure your environment"
      - content: "To control who can access Azure resources from the perimeter network"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This answer is incorrect. To control inbound access to Azure, you would use authentication and authorization policies. Network virtual appliances aren't used to authenticate users."
    - content: "How might you deploy a network virtual appliance?"
      choices:
      - content: "You can configure a Windows virtual machine and enable IP forwarding, once routing tables, user-defined routes and subnets have been updated, or use a third-party image from the marketplace"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "This is the correct answer. Many customers create network virtual appliances, and you can download many third-party appliances available from the Azure marketplace"
      - content: "Using Azure CLI, deploy a Linux virtual machine in Azure, connect this to your production virtual network and assign a public IP address"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This answer is incorrect. Simply deploying a virtual machine won't enable it to function as a network virtual appliance"
      - content: "Using Azure portal, deploy a Windows 2016 Server. Create an Azure Application Gateway and add the Windows 2016 Server as a target endpoint."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This answer is incorrect. This solution is simply deploying a server that sits behind a load balancer. This has no bearing on deploying a network virtual appliance"
      - content: "Download a third-party virtual appliance from the Azure marketplace and configure the appliance to connect to the production and perimeter networks"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This answer is incorrect. Although this forms half of the solution, simply installing a virtual appliance and connecting it to your networks won't control the flow of traffic"
