Image classification is playing an increasingly large role in industry as a means for automating such tasks as checking images uploaded to web sites for offensive content and inspecting parts rolling off assembly lines for defects. Building an image-classification model manually — that is, coding it from the ground up in Python, R, or another language — is costly and requires expertise. The Custom Vision Service enables virtually anyone to build sophisticated image-classification models. And once a model is built and trained, an app that uses it is only few lines of code away.
