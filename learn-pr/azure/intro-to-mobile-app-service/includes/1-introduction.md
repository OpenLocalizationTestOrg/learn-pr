Implementing backend services for mobile applications can be challenging because you often need a variety services to support your users. The services you need to protect the customer data include: data storage, user authentication, data synchronization from client devices, and the ability to send notifications to variety of mobile device types. Implementing all of these services individually is time consuming and potentially challenging. Azure Mobile Apps in Azure App Service simplifies data management, authentication, and notifications to support client applications running on mobile devices.

Suppose you're working at startup that's creating mobile apps to coordinate, schedule, and join local sports events. You want to provide a mobile client that runs on all modern mobile devices, but you need to be able to store event data in a secure, accessible location, that allows users to save and edit preferences. You want your users to be able to use any of their devices to access your service, not just the device they used to sign up. Finally, you want to be able to send notifications to your users to let them know about local events that match their preferences.

Here, you'll see how Azure Mobile Apps in Azure App Service can simplify creating a complete mobile app backend to support your mobile client applications.
