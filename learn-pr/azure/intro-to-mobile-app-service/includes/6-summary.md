Most mobile client applications built today send or receive data online. Having a reliable backend suite of services can help accelerate your mobile app development. Our example sporting events application could make excellent use of the services by Mobile Apps in Azure App Service. We could store event data in a SQL database, synchronize user preferences, authenticate users to ensure we protect sensitive data, and send push notifications to ensure our users don't miss the events that are important and relevant to them.

In Azure, it is possible to create and connect all of the services needed to support mobile client apps manually, however Mobile Apps in Azure App Service simplifies the creation and integration steps, allowing you to focus on building great mobile apps, instead of building out the backend infrastructure.

As well, Mobile Apps is part of Azure and they can be integrated with other Azure services to extend your product or exchange data with other services.
