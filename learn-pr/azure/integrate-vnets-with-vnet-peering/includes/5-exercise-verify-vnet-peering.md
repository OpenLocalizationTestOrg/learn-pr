In the previous unit, you configured peering connections between the virtual networks to enable resources to communicate with each other. Your configuration used a hub and spoke topology. MarketingVNet was the hub, and SalesVNet and ResearchVNet were spokes.

![A hub and spoke topology for virtual networks](../media/5-hub-spoke-network.svg)

Remember, peering connections are nontransitive. Intermediate virtual networks don't allow connectivity to flow through them to connected virtual networks. **SalesVNet** can communicate with **MarketingVNet**. **ResearchVNet** can communicate with **MarketingVNet**. **MarketingVNet** can communicate with both **SalesVNet** and **ResearchVNet**. The only communication that's not permitted is between **SalesVNet** and **ResearchVNet**. Even though **SalesVNet** and **ResearchVNet** are both connected to **MarketingVNet**, they can't communicate with each other because they're not directly peered to each other.

Let's confirm the connectivity across the peering connections. To do this, you'll first create a connection from Azure Cloud Shell to a target VM's *public* IP address. Then you'll connect from the target VM to the destination VM by using the destination VM's *private* IP address.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To test the virtual network peering connection, connect to the private IP address assigned to each VM.

1. To connect to your VMs, you'll use SSH (Secure Shell) directly from Cloud Shell. When using SSH, you first find the public IP addresses that are assigned to your test VMs.

1. In Cloud Shell, run the following command to list the IP addresses you'll use to connect to the VMs:

    ```azurecli
    az vm list \
        --resource-group <rgn>[sandbox resource group name]</rgn> \
        --query "[*].{Name:name, PrivateIP:privateIps, PublicIP:publicIps}" \
        --show-details \
        --output table
    ```

1. Record the output. You'll need the IP addresses for the exercises in this unit.

Before you start the tests, think about what you've learned in this module. What results do you expect? Which VMs will and will not be able to communicate with each other?

## Test connections from SalesVM

In the first test, in Cloud Shell you'll use SSH to connect to the public IP address of **SalesVM**. You'll then attempt to connect from **SalesVM** to **MarketingVM** and **ResearchVM**.

1. In Cloud Shell, run the following command, using SSH to connect to the public IP address of **SalesVM**. In the command, replace `<SalesVM public IP>` with the VM's *public* IP address.

   ```bash
   ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no azureuser@<SalesVM public IP>
   ```

   ![Connect to the public IP address of SalesVM](../media/5-sales-step-1.svg)

1. Sign in with the password that you used to create the VM. The prompt now shows that you're signed in to **SalesVM**.

1. In Cloud Shell, run the following command, using SSH to connect to the private IP address of **MarketingVM**. In the command, replace `<MarketingVM private IP>` with this VM's *private* IP address.

   ```bash
   ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no azureuser@<MarketingVM private IP>
   ```

   ![Connect from SalesVM to the private IP address of MarketingVM](../media/5-sales-step-5.svg)

    The connection attempt should succeed because of the peering connection between the **SalesVNet** and **MarketingVNet** virtual networks.

1. Sign in by using the password you used to create the VM.

1. Enter `exit` to close this SSH session and return to the **SalesVM** prompt.

1. In Cloud Shell, run the following command, using SSH to connect to the private IP address of **ResearchVM**. In the command, replace `<ResearchVM private IP>` with this VM's *private* IP address.

   ```bash
   ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no azureuser@<ResearchVM private IP>
   ```

1. The connection attempt should fail because there's no peering connection between the **SalesVNet** and **ResearchVNet** virtual networks. Up to 60 seconds might pass before the connection attempt times out. To force the attempt to stop, use Ctrl+C.

1. Enter `exit` to close the SSH session and return to Cloud Shell.

## Test connections from ResearchVM

In the second test, in Cloud Shell you'll use SSH to connect to the public IP address of **ResearchVM**. You'll then attempt to connect from **ResearchVM** to **MarketingVM** and **SalesVM**.

1. In Cloud Shell, run the following command, using SSH to connect to the public IP address of **ResearchVM**. In the command, replace `<ResearchVM public IP>` with this VM's *public* IP address.

   ```bash
   ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no azureuser@<ResearchVM public IP>
   ```

   ![Connect to the public IP address of ResearchVM](../media/5-research-step-1.svg)

1. Sign in by using the password that you used to create the VM. The prompt now shows that you're signed in to **ResearchVM**.

1. In Cloud Shell, run the following command, using SSH to connect to the private IP address of **MarketingVM**. In the command, replace `<MarketingVM private IP>` with this VM's *private* IP address.

   ```bash
   ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no azureuser@<MarketingVM private IP>
   ```

   ![Connect to the private IP address of MarketingVM](../media/5-research-step-5.svg)

    The connection attempt should succeed because of the peering connection between the **ResearchVNet** and **MarketingVNet** virtual networks.

1. Sign in by using the password you used to create the VM.

1. Enter `exit` to close this SSH session and return to the **ResearchVM** prompt.

1. In Cloud Shell, run the following command, using SSH to connect to the private IP address of **SalesVM**. In the command, replace `<SalesVM private IP>` with this VM's *private* IP address.

   ```bash
   ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no azureuser@<SalesVM private IP>
   ```

1. The connection attempt should fail because there's no peering connection between the **ResearchVNet** and **SalesVNet** virtual networks. Up to 60 seconds might pass before the connection attempt times out. To force the attempt to stop, use Ctrl+C.

   ![The attempt fails to connect ResearchVM to the private IP address of SalesVM](../media/5-research-step-9.svg)

1. Enter `exit` to close the SSH session and return to Cloud Shell.

## Test connections from Marketing VM

In the final test, in Cloud Shell you'll use SSH to connect to the public IP address of **MarketingVM**. You'll then attempt to connect from **MarketingVM** to **ResearchVM** and **SalesVM**.

1. In Cloud Shell, run the following command, using SSH to connect to the public IP address of **MarketingVM**. In the command, replace `<MarketingVM public IP>` with this VM's *public* IP address.

   ```bash
   ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no azureuser@<MarketingVM public IP>
   ```

   ![Connect to the public IP address of MarketingVM](../media/5-marketing-step-1.svg)

1. Sign in by using the password that you used to create the VM. The prompt shows that you're signed in to **MarketingVM**.

1. In Cloud Shell, run the following command, using SSH to connect to the private IP address of **ResearchVM**. In the command, replace `<ResearchVM private IP>` with this VM's *private* IP address.

    ```bash
    ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no azureuser@<ResearchVM private IP>
    ```

    ![Connect to the private IP address of SalesVM](../media/5-marketing-step-5.svg)

    The connection attempt should succeed because of the peering connection between the **MarketingVNet** and **ResearchVNet** virtual networks.

1. Sign in by using the password you used to create the VM.

1. Enter `exit` to close this SSH session and return to the **MarketingVM** prompt.

1. In Cloud Shell, run the following command, using SSH to connect to the private IP address of **SalesVM**. In the command, replace `<SalesVM private IP>` with this VM's *private* IP address.

   ```bash
   ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no azureuser@<SalesVM private IP>
   ```

   The connection attempt should also succeed because there *is* a peering connection between the **MarketingVNet** and **SalesVNet** virtual networks.

   ![Connect to the private IP address of SalesVM](../media/5-marketing-step-9.svg)

1. Sign in by using the password you used to create the VM.

1. Enter `exit` to close this SSH session and return to the **MarketingVM** prompt.

1. Enter `exit` to close the SSH session and return to Cloud Shell.

This is a simple test using SSH. It demonstrates network connectivity between peered virtual networks. It also demonstrates lack of network connectivity for transitive connections. 

If these servers were running application services, the server connectivity would allow communication between the services running on the VMs. The connectivity would allow the business to share data across departments as required.
