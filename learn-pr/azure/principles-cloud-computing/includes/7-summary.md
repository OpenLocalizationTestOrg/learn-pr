- Different types of cloud models that are available and the considerations of using those different models. 
- Some of the key terms and concepts such as high availability, agility, elasticity, fault tolerance, and CapEx vs. OpEx. 
- The different cloud services available, the benefits of using the different types, and the management responsibilities under each service type. 
- Cloud models such as public, private and hybrid, and what the key characteristics of each model are.
- The different types of cloud service available: IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS; what the key characteristics of each service are and when you would choose one over the other.

### Microsoft Azure

Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing platform. Azure provides over 100 services that enable you to do everything from running your existing applications on virtual machines to exploring new software paradigms such as intelligent bots and mixed reality.

Here are just a few kinds of services you'll find on Azure:

- **Compute** services such as VMs and containers that can run your applications
- **Database** services that provide both relational and NoSQL choices
- **Identity** services that help you authenticate and protect your users
- **Networking** services that connect your datacenter to the cloud, provide high availability or host your DNS domain
- **Storage** solutions that can accommodate massive amounts of both structured and unstructured data
- **AI and machine-learning** services can analyze data, text, images, comprehend speech, and make predictions using data â€” changing the world of agriculture, healthcare, and much more.
- And many more!
