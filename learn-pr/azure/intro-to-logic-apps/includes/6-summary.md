Our goal was to help you evaluate whether Logic Apps would be a good choice for your business process. We developed some criteria you can use to guide your decision:

* Integration
* Performance
* Conditionals
* Connectors

You'd analyze your business process against each of these criteria. The results should give you an idea of how close a match Logic Apps is to your needs.

We applied these criteria to our fictional shoe company. The analysis helped us see how difficult it would be to use Logic Apps for each process. Both the *social-media monitor* and the *video archive utility* used only the built-in connectors. This characteristic made them perfect for Logic Apps. The *online sales portal* required more work because it had complex conditionals and needed custom connectors.

The criteria help you evaluate your business processes. First, they let you assess how well Logic Apps will solve your problem. Second, they give you an idea of the amount of effort involved. This strategy takes some of the guesswork out of your decision of whether to use Logic Apps.
