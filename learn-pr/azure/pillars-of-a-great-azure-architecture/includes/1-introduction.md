Imagine you work for a healthcare provider. How do you instill confidence in your customers that their data is secure? Can your architecture handle a spike in traffic if a media report goes viral? Can your architecture handle the failure of one or more critical components? Are you using resources in the most efficient manner possible?

A great architecture helps guide you to design, build, and continuously improve a secure, reliable, and efficient application. In this module, we'll introduce you to the pillars and principles that are essential to a great Azure architecture.

> [!NOTE]
> The concepts discussed in this module are not all-inclusive, but represent some of the important considerations when building a solution on the cloud. Microsoft publishes a broad set of patterns, guidelines, and examples on designing applications on Azure. It is highly recommended that you look through the content in the [Azure Architecture Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/) as you start planning and designing your architecture.
