Companies that have built applications based on Azure Storage tables sometimes find that their needs outgrow that platform. They can often solve their issues by migrating to Azure Cosmos DB.

Suppose that you work for a camera company. Your company has developed a customer-facing application that is currently using tables in an Azure Storage account to store data about the lenses that the company produces. Demand from users is growing rapidly. You can easily get better scaling, availability, and latency by moving the application to Azure Cosmos DB. Developers must be able to list the advantages, disadvantages, and use cases for the Table API in Azure Cosmos DB to validate their data storage choices to stakeholders.

In this module, you will learn the process for creating an Azure Cosmos DB database with the Table storage API, and learn the structure of the JSON documents used by the Table API.

By the end of this module, you will have migrated data from Azure Table storage to the Azure Cosmos DB Table API. You will also have updated your application to point to your new data location.

## Learning objectives

At the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Describe the advantages of Table Storage and Azure Cosmos DB
- Modify an existing Table API application to use Azure Cosmos DB

## Prerequisites

- Ability to create and develop NoSQL databases
- Ability to create and develop Azure Cosmos DB databases
