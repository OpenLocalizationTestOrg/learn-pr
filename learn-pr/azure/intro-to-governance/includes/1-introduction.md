Good IT governance involves planning your initiatives and setting priorities on a strategic level to help manage and prevent issues.

You need good governance when:

- You have multiple engineering teams working in Azure
- You have multiple subscriptions in your tenant
- You have regulatory requirements which must be enforced
- You want to ensure standards are followed for all IT allocated resources

You could enforce standards by not allowing teams to directly create Azure resources - and instead have the IT team define and deploy all cloud-based assets. This is often the solution in on-premises solutions, but this reduces the team agility and ability to innovate. Instead, Azure provides several tools you can use to enforce and validate your standards, while still allowing your engineering teams to create and own their own resources in the cloud.

In addition to providing IT standards, you need to be able to monitor your resources to make sure they are responsive and performing properly. Azure provides several built-in features to track and analyze your resource utilization and performance.

In this module, you will:

- Apply policies to control and audit resource creation
- Learn how role-based security can fine-tune access to your resources
- Understand Microsoft's policies and privacy guarantees
- Learn how to monitor your resources
