**Microsoft Azure Information Protection** (sometimes referred to as AIP) is a cloud-based solution that helps organizations classify and optionally protect documents and emails by applying labels.

Labels can be applied automatically based on rules and conditions, manually, or a combination of both where users are guided by recommendations.

The following screen capture is an example of AIP in action on a user's computer. In this example, the administrator has configured a label with rules that detect sensitive data. When a user saves a Microsoft Word document containing a credit card number, a custom tooltip is displayed. The tooltip recommends labeling the file as *Confidential - All Employees*, which is a label that the administrator has configured. This label classifies the document and protects it.

After your content is classified, you can track and control how the content is used. For example, you can:

- Analyze data flows to gain insight into your business
- Detect risky behaviors and take corrective measures
- Track access to documents
- Prevent data leakage or misuse of confidential information

> [!NOTE] 
> You can purchase AIP either as a standalone solution, or through one of the following Microsoft licensing suites: Enterprise Mobility + Security, or Microsoft 365 Enterprise.
