    title: Check your knowledge
    questions:
    - content: "Cloud security is a shared responsibility between you and your cloud provider. Which category of cloud services requires the greatest security effort on your part?"
      choices:
      - content: "Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "At this level, the cloud provider provides physical security to compute resources. However, it's your responsibility to patch and secure your operating systems and software, as well as configure your network to be secure."
      - content: "Platform as a service (PaaS)"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "At this level, the cloud provider handles many security concerns, more than with other categories. This includes providing physical security and keeping operating systems patched and up to date."
      - content: "Software as a service (SaaS)"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "At this level, the cloud provider handles most security concerns for you. Your main responsibility is to provide your organization's users with proper access to the software."
    - content: "Which of these helps you most easily disable an account when an employee leaves your company?"
      choices:
      - content: "Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA)"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "While MFA provides additional security by requiring two or more elements for full authentication, it doesn't help you disable inactive accounts."
      - content: "Monitor sign-on attempts"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "While monitoring can help you discover when someone attempts unauthorized access to one of your services, monitoring alone won't help you disable inactive accounts."
      - content: "Use single sign-on (SSO)"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "SSO centralizes user identity, so you can disable an inactive account in a single step."
    - content: "Which of these is the _strongest_ way to protect sensitive customer data?"
      choices:
      - content: "Encrypt data as it sits in your database"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "While encrypting your data as it sits in your database (encryption at rest) is important, your data may be read by others as it travels over the network between systems."
      - content: "Encrypt data as it travels over the network"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "While encrypting your data as it travels over the network (encryption in transit) is important, your data may be vulnerable as it sits in your database."
      - content: "Encrypt data both as it sits in your database and as it travels over the network"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Encrypting your data at all times, both as it sits in your database and as it travels over the network, minimizes the opportunity for an attacker to access your data in plain text."
    - content: "There has been an attack on your public-facing website, and the application's resources have been overwhelmed and exhausted, and are now unavailable to users. What service should you use to prevent this type of attack?"
      choices:
      - content: "DDoS protection"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "DDoS protection is the correct answer, because it will help prevent DDoS attacks."
      - content: "Azure Firewall"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Azure Firewall is incorrect. It will helps control access to your network, but may not prevent DDoS attacks."
      - content: "Network Security Group"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Network security group is incorrect, because while it will help protect access to your virtual network, it may not prevent a DDoS attack."
      - content: "Application Gateway"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Application Gateway is incorrect. While it will help make an application available and help protect it, and it also has a built in web application firewall, it won't prevent DDoS-style attacks."
    - content: "You want to store certificates in Azure to centrally manage them for your services. Which Azure service should you use?"
      choices:
      - content: "AIP"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "AIP is a cloud-based solution that helps an organization classify, and optionally, protect its documents and emails by applying labels."
      - content: "Azure AD"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Azure AD is Microsoftâ€™s cloud-based identity and access management service that helps employees of an organization sign in and access resources."      
      - content: "Azure Key Vault"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Azure Key Vault is the correct answer, because it is a centralized cloud service for storing application secrets, referred to as a secret store."
      - content: "Azure ATP"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Azure ATP is a cloud-based security solution that identifies, detects, and helps organizations investigate advanced threats, compromised identities, and malicious insider actions directed at that organization."
