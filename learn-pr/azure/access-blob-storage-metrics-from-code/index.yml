  title: Access metrics from your Azure Blob Storage Containers Programmatically
  description: In order to provide a reliable service, you should make sure that all your business-critical systems are carefully monitored. For services in Azure, the Azure Monitor provides a unified tool that gathers, stores and displays performance metrics. If you use an Azure Storage account to store blobs, metrics will be added to Azure Monitor to record that account's behavior. In this module, you will learn how to configure and access those metrics from .NET application code, which you might use to develop mobile device apps or web apps.
