    choices:
    - content: "Cost"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Code that uses the client library is much shorter and simpler than code that uses the REST API. The client library handles assembling requests and parsing responses for you."
    - content: "Availability"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Code that uses the client library is much shorter and simpler than code that uses the REST API. The client library handles assembling requests and parsing responses for you."
    - content: "Localization"

  - content: "Which of the following is a good analogy for the access keys of a storage account?"
    choices:
    - content: "IP Address"
      isCorrect: false

      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Possession of an access key identifies the account and grants you access. This is very similar to login credentials like a username and password."
    - content: "Cryptographic algorithm"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Possession of an access key identifies the account and grants you access. This is very similar to login credentials like a username and password."
