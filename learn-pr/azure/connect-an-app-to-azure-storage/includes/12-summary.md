You have learned the basics of creating and connecting to an Azure storage account. You wrote a simple application to connect to a storage account and create a blob container. Other modules in this Learning Path will build on that knowledge to show you how to use Blob Storage and Queues to store data and connect apps together.

We only used examples of JavaScript and C#, but Azure supports a variety of other languages. Check the official [SDK Tools documentation page](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/#pivot=sdkstools) to find the official list of links to the client libraries for all the currently supported languages.
