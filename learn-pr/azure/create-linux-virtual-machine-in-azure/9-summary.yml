  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: "True or false: for security reasons, you must use an image from the official Azure Marketplace when creating a new virtual machine."
    choices:
    - content: "True"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure lets you configure your virtual machines to meet your needs. This includes support for using your own VM images."
    - content: "False"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure lets you configure your virtual machines to meet your needs. This includes support for using your own VM images."

  - content: "What is the effect of the default network security settings for a new virtual machine?"
    choices:
    - content: "Neither outbound nor inbound requests are allowed."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Outbound requests are considered low risk, so they are allowed by default."
    - content: "Outbound request are allowed. Inbound traffic is only allowed from within the virtual network."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Outbound requests are considered low risk, so they are allowed by default. Inbound traffic from within the virtual network is allowed. By placing a VM in a virtual network, the VM owner is implicitly opting-in to communication among the resources in the virtual network."
    - content: "There are no restrictions: all outbound and inbound requests are allowed."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Unrestricted inbound traffic is too risky for the default behavior."

  - content: "Suppose you have several Linux virtual machines hosted in Azure. You will administer these VMs remotely over SSH from three dedicated machines in your corporate headquarters. Which of the following authentication methods would typically be considered best-practice for this situation?"
    choices:
    - content: "Username and password"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Passwords are vulnerable to brute-force attacks. This method is only recommended if you require remote access from a variety of locations."
    - content: "Private key"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Private-key access is more secure than a password and is a good option when you require access from a limited number of locations. However, if an attacker acquires your private key, they can use it to access your VMs."
    - content: "Private key with passphrase"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Private key access with a passphrase is the most secure option. Even if an attacker acquires your private key, they will be unable to use it without the passphrase."
