Cloud computing provides configurable computing resources and services that can be quickly provisioned with minimal management effort. There are Azure services for almost any business computing need. Do you need an interactive website? A back end for a mobile app? Secure storage for your client data? All of these and more are available. And these resources are available when you need them, and you're typically only charged for the amount you use.

Hopefully, the cloud is an attractive option, but what if you already have existing on-premises infrastructure? Or you have highly sensitive data that you're not willing or able to store off-site?

Azure provides several configurations allowing you to blend or transition between on-premises and a solution hosted completely in the cloud.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Compare each cloud computing deployment model (public, private, and hybrid).
- Understand the advantages of each cloud computing service model.
- Decide which deployment and service model you should use for your services.
