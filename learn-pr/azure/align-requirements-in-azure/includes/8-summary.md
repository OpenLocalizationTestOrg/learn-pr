In this module, you explored the concepts of cloud computing. Cloud computing is the provisioning of services and applications on demand over the internet. Servers, applications, data, and other resources are provided as a service. 

Cloud computing resources are delivered using three different service models:

1. Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) provides instant computing infrastructure that you can provision and manage over the Internet.

2. Platform as a service (PaaS) provides ready-made development and deployment environments that you can use to deliver your own cloud services.

3. Software as a service (or SaaS) delivers applications over the Internet as a web-based service.
