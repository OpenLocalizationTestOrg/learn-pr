Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is an instant computing infrastructure, provisioned and managed over the Internet. IaaS enables you to quickly scale resources to meet demand and only pay for what you use. IaaS avoids the expense and complexity of buying and managing your own physical servers and other datacenter infrastructure. Each resource is offered as a separate service component, and you *rent* the resource as long as you need it. As a result, IaaS is flexible. You can provision common infrastructure such as VMs, storage, virtual subnets, firewalls, and VPNs to build a solution. You don't need to manage physical servers and appliances. However, you are responsible for configuring and managing the components. For example, configuring firewalls, updating VM OS's, updating DBMS's, and runtimes.

### Common scenarios 

Let's imagine your healthcare company has a need to run a special version of desktop software. The software is only supported on a specific version of an operating system and only one user license is required. You can create a virtual machine with the required software. The user can use a remote desktop connection to connect to the virtual machine to use the software.

Let's imagine another scenario. Your development teams need several unique development environments. Through the development cycle, they need to test various versions of the product. The developers can provision environments when needed. When an environment is no longer needed, it can be easily deleted.

Some other common scenarios include:

**Website hosting:** If you want more control of hosting a website, running websites using IaaS may be a better option than traditional web hosting.

**Web apps:** IaaS provides all the infrastructure to support web apps, including storage, web and application servers, and networking resources. Organizations can quickly deploy web apps on IaaS and easily scale infrastructure up and down when demand for the apps is unpredictable.

**Storage, backup, and recovery:** Storage management can be complex, requiring a large capital investment and skilled staff to manage data and meet legal and compliance requirements. IaaS can help simplify planning, management, unpredictable demand, and steadily growing storage needs.

**High-performance computing:** If you have a workload that requires high-performance computing, you can run the workload in the cloud avoiding the up-front cost of the hardware and only pay for the usage when needed. 

**Big data analysis:** If you have large data sets that contain potentially valuable patterns, trends, and associations, IaaS can provide the processing power to mine data sets to locate patterns.

### Advantages

**Eliminates capital expense and reduces ongoing cost:** IaaS sidesteps the upfront expense of setting up and managing an on-site datacenter, making it an economical option for start-ups and businesses testing new ideas. As soon as you’ve decided to launch a new product or initiative, the necessary computing infrastructure can be ready in minutes or hours, rather than the days or weeks—and sometimes months—it could take to set up internally.

**Improves business continuity and disaster recovery:** Achieving high availability, business continuity, and disaster recovery is expensive, since it requires a significant amount of technology and staff. But with the right service level agreement (SLA) in place, IaaS can reduce this cost and access applications and data as usual during a disaster or outage.

**Respond quicker to shifting business conditions:** IaaS enables you to quickly scale up resources to accommodate spikes in demand for your application— during the holidays, for example—then scale resources back down again when activity decreases to save money. Because you don’t need to first set up the infrastructure before you can develop and deliver apps, you can get them to users faster with IaaS.

**Increase stability, reliability, and supportability:** With IaaS, there’s no need to maintain and upgrade hardware or troubleshoot equipment problems. With the appropriate agreement in place, the service provider assures that your infrastructure is reliable and meets SLAs.
