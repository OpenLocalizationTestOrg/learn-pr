To create and use Azure services, you will need an Azure _account_. The account is free, and it allows you to build and deploy cloud-based applications, utilize sophisticated artificial intelligence services, and extract essential insights from your data.

With an Azure account, you can use a variety of free and paid services to create the next-generation architecture for your product and users.
