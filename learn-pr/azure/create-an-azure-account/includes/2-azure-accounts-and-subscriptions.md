## What is an Azure account?

An _Azure account_ is tied to a specific identity and holds information like:

- Name, email, and contact preferences
- Billing information such as a credit card

An Azure account is what you use to sign in to the Azure website and administer or deploy services. Every Azure account is associated with one or more  _subscriptions_.

## What is an Azure subscription?

An _Azure subscription_ is a logical container used to provision resources in Microsoft Azure. It holds the details of all your resources like virtual machines, databases, etc.
