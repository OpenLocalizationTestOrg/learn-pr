To use Visual Studio Code for Azure development, you'll need to install Visual Studio Code locally and one or more Azure extensions. In this exercise, we'll add the **Azure App Service** extension.

## Install Visual Studio Code

To install Visual Studio Code, use the appropriate steps for your operating system.

### Windows

1. [Download the Visual Studio Code installer for Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

1. Run the installer.

1. Open Visual Studio Code by pressing the Windows key or clicking the Windows icon on the task bar, typing "Visual Studio Code" and clicking on the **Visual Studio Code** result.

### macOS

1. [Download Visual Studio Code for macOS](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

1. Double-click on the downloaded archive to expand the contents.

1. Drag Visual Studio Code.app to the Applications folder.

1. Open Visual Studio Code by clicking on the icon the Apps section or by searching for Visual Studio Code in Spotlight.

### Linux

#### Debian and Ubuntu

1. Download and install the [.deb package (64-bit)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=760868) through the graphical software center, if it's available, or through the command line (replacing `<file>` with the .deb filename you downloaded):

   ```bash
   sudo dpkg -i <file>.deb
   sudo apt-get install -f # Install dependencies
   ```

#### RHEL, Fedora, and CentOS

1. Use the following script to install the key and repository:

   ```bash
   sudo rpm --import https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc
   sudo sh -c 'echo -e "[code]\nname=Visual Studio Code\nbaseurl=https://packages.microsoft.com/yumrepos/vscode\nenabled=1\ngpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc" > etc/yum.repos.d/vscode.repo'
   ```

1. Update the package cache, and install the package by using dnf (Fedora 22 and above):

   ```bash
   dnf check-update
   sudo dnf install code
   ```

#### openSUSE and SLE

1. The yum repository also works for openSUSE and SLE-based systems. The following script will install the key and repository:

   ```bash
   sudo rpm --import https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc
   sudo sh -c 'echo -e "[code]\nname=Visual Studio Code\nbaseurl=https://packages.microsoft.com/yumrepos/vscode\nenabled=1\ntype=rpm-md\ngpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc" > /etc/zypp/repos.d/vscode.repo'
   ```

1. Update the package cache and install the package by using:

   ```bash
   sudo zypper refresh
   sudo zypper install code
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> For further details about installing or updating Visual Studio Code on various Linux distributions, please see the [Running Visual Studio Code on Linux documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux).

Here, you'll install Visual Studio on either your Windows or your macOS development machine.

## Exercise steps

To install Visual Studio, use the appropriate steps for your operating system.

### Windows

1. Download the Visual Studio installer from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/.

1. Run the installer.

1. On the **Workloads** tab, select the **Azure development** workload.

   The following screenshot shows the Visual Studio Installer workload selected to allow Azure development within Visual Studio.

   ![Screenshot of the Visual Studio Installer with the Azure development workload highlighted.](../media/5-select-azure-workload.png)

1. (Optional) Install the ASP.NET and web development workload to be ready to create web applications for Azure.

1. Click **Install**, and wait for Visual Studio to install. For systems with Visual Studio already installed, this button may say **Modify**.

1. When the installation is complete, open Visual Studio.

1. Go to the View menu in Visual Studio and make sure you have the **Cloud Explorer** option.

   The following screenshot shows the Cloud Explorer menu option that will be present if you have the Azure development workload installed.

### macOS

1. Go to https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ and download the Visual Studio for Mac installer.

1. Click the VisualStudioInstaller.dmg file to mount the installer, then run it by double-clicking the logo.

1. Acknowledge the Privacy and License terms when presented.

1. The installer will ask which components you wish to install. Azure components are already part of Visual Studio for Mac, but it is recommended to install the **.NET Core** platform to develop web experiences for Azure.

   The following screenshot shows the .NET Core platform required to add Azure development capabilities to Visual Studio for Mac.

   ![Screenshot of the Visual Studio for Mac installer with the selected .NET Core platform option highlighted.](../media/5-vsmac-install-net-core.png)
