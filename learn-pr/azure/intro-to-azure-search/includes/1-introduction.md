Azure Search is a private enterprise search solution that allows your organization to combine its searchable content into a single fast index. The index can then be used for internal only use, or to enable searchable content on your public facing internet assets. 

You work for a fitness startup that publishes exercise videos. The company is just getting started establishing an online presence, and you've been asked to provide a searchable index of your companies video catalog. Your startup has created a number of videos in a catalog, and want to search across different properties, such as title, difficulty, length, and publication date. For your business to be successful, your customers need to be able to quickly find and watch your videos.

In this module, you'll look at what Azure Search is, how to design and create an index, and how to load data into it. You'll then look at how to maintain and interact with Azure Search in the Azure portal.
