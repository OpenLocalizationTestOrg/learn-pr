We've looked at the core pieces of what makes up the N-tier style of architecture, you've deployed an example application in this architectural style, and seen how the tiers worked together.

Now that you understand N-tier architecture and how it helps separate concerns within your solution, you can use this powerful, yet relatively simple, architecture to build or migrate maintainable, scalable, and securable cloud applications.

## Azure Architecture Center

We've only scratched the surface of architecture on the cloud. The [Azure Architecture Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/) has a wealth of resources you can use to make architectures of all styles, including N-tier, run at their best. On it you'll find design guides, reference architectures, and enterprise cloud adoption guidelines to help you be successful in any cloud journey you may be taking.

Take a look through the [N-tier architecture style](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/guide/architecture-styles/n-tier) document on the Architecture Center for more information on this style and browse through other architecture styles.

## Additional resources

The source code for the application is available in the [MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-n-tier-architecture](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-n-tier-architecture) GitHub repository if you'd like to see more or use it in your own environment. 

One item we didn't cover in much detail was the mechanics of the deployment through the resource manager template. For more information on how these work, take the [Build Azure Resource Manager templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/build-azure-vm-templates/) module. Templates are a fantastic way to automate your infrastructure, and this module can help you get started.

The [Architect great solutions in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/architect-great-solutions-in-azure/) learning path has guidance on how to build a solid foundation for any architecture on Azure.
