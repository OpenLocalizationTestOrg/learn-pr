Imagine you work for an online clothing retailer. You've been asked to prototype a new data storage solution for the inventory system based on Azure Cosmos DB. You've already decided on a test database schema and are now exploring how to insert and query data with the SQL API, stored procedures, and user-defined functions (UDFs).

Azure Cosmos DB provides the Data Explorer tool in the Azure portal that you can use to perform all these operations: adding data, modifying data, and creating and running stored procedures. The Data Explorer can be used in the Azure portal or it can be undocked and used in a standalone browser window, providing additional space to work with your data.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Create product catalog documents in the Data Explorer
- Perform Azure Cosmos DB queries
- Create and run operations on your documents by using stored procedures

## Prerequisites

- Have an understanding of databases and queries
- Beginner-level experience with Azure Cosmos DB: creating accounts, databases, and containers; managing partitions
