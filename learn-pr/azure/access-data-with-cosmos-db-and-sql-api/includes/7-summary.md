In this module, you've created multiple documents, each representing a product in your product catalog. You've learned about the types of queries you can perform on your data and performed those queries, and you've learned how to perform complex operations and store them on the database engine by using stored procedures and UDFs. 

These fundamentals give you insight into how Azure Cosmos DB works and how you can use it as the foundation for large database projects like e-commerce applications, which require the ability to quickly query and display data in a catalog, and perform operations and transactions on data in the database.
