Your business relies on access to the systems and data that make it run. Every minute that your customers or your internal teams don’t have access to what they need can result in a loss of revenue. It is our job to make sure that doesn’t happen.

As we learn about architecting our cloud solutions to be highly available and to have the capability to recover from localized and widespread issues, we'll see how one fictional Azure customer puts these principles to work:

Lamna Healthcare is a national healthcare provider. Their IT organization has recently started to move the majority of their IT systems to Azure. They have a mixture of custom apps, open-source apps, and off-the-shelf applications, with varying architectures and technology platforms. We'll learn what they need to do to migrate to the cloud while keeping their systems and data secure.

> [!NOTE]
> The concepts discussed in this module are not all-inclusive, but represent some of the important considerations when building a solution on the cloud. Microsoft publishes a broad set of patterns, guidelines, and examples on designing applications on Azure. It's highly recommended that you look through the content in the [Azure Architecture Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/) as you start planning and designing your architecture.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Leverage Azure services to design a highly available application
- Incorporate Azure disaster recovery capabilities into your architecture
- Backup and restore on Azure to protect your application from data loss or corruption
