  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: How does using managed identities for Azure resources change the way an app authenticates to Azure Key Vault?
    choices:
    - content: The app uses a certificate to authenticate instead of a secret.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: When you enable managed identity on your web app, Azure activates a separate token-granting REST service specifically for use by your app. Your app will request tokens from this service instead of Azure Active Directory.
    - content: Each user of the app must enter a password.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: When you enable managed identity on your web app, Azure activates a separate token-granting REST service specifically for use by your app. Your app will request tokens from this service instead of Azure Active Directory.
    - content: The app gets tokens from a token service instead of Azure Active Directory.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: When you enable managed identity on your web app, Azure activates a separate token-granting REST service specifically for use by your app. Your app will request tokens from this service instead of Azure Active Directory.
    - content: Managed identities are automatically recognized by Azure Key Vault and authenticated automatically.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: When you enable managed identity on your web app, Azure activates a separate token-granting REST service specifically for use by your app. Your app will request tokens from this service instead of Azure Active Directory.

  - content: Which one of these statements describes a primary benefit of using managed identities for Azure resources to authenticate an app to Key Vault?
    choices:
    - content: Using managed identities improves application performance.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Your app authenticates to a managed identities token service with a secret injected into its environment variables at runtime. This eliminates the need to store secrets during configuration.
    - content: Using managed identities eliminates the need to handle secrets during configuration.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Your app authenticates to a managed identities token service with a secret injected into its environment variables at runtime. This eliminates the need to store secrets during configuration.
    - content: Managed identities can automatically grant Azure Key Vault permissions.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Your app authenticates to a managed identities token service with a secret injected into its environment variables at runtime. This eliminates the need to store secrets during configuration.
