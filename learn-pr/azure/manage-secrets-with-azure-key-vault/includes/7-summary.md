In this module, you secured an app's secret configuration in Azure Key Vault. Our app code authenticates to the vault with a managed identity and automatically loads the secrets from the vault into memory at startup.

To cleanup your Cloud Shell storage, delete the `KeyVaultDemoApp` directory.

## Next steps

If this was a real app, what would come next?

- Put all your app secrets in your vaults! There's no longer any reason to have them in configuration files.
- Continue to develop the application. Your production environment is all set up, so for future deployments to it you don't need to repeat all the setup.
- To support development, create a development-environment vault that contains secrets with the same names but different values. Grant permissions to the development team and configure the vault name in the app's development-environment configuration file. Configuration depends on your implementation: for ASP.NET Core, `AddAzureKeyVault` will automatically detect local installations of Visual Studio and the Azure CLI and use Azure credentials configured in those applications to sign in and access the vault. For Node.js, you can create a development-environment service principal with permissions to the vault and have the app authenticate using `loginWithServicePrincipalSecret`.
- Create additional environments for purposes like user acceptance testing.
- Separate vaults across different subscriptions and/or resource groups to isolate them.
- Grant access to other environment vaults to the appropriate people.
