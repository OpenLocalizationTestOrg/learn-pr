  questions:
  - content: "Which type of transactional database system would work best for product data?"
    choices:
    - content: "OLAP"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "OLTP systems support a large set of users, have quick response times, handle large volumes of data, are highly available, and are great for small or relatively simple transactions."
    - content: "OLTP"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "OLTP systems support a large set of users, have quick response times, handle large volumes of data, are highly available, and are great for small or relatively simple transactions."

  - content: "Suppose the operations to update inventory and process payments are in the same transaction. A user is attempting to apply store credit for the full amount of an order, and submitted the exact same order (for the full amount) using their phone and laptop at the same time - so two identical orders are received. The database behind the scenes is an ACID-compliant database, what would happen?" 
    choices:
    - content: "Both orders would be processed and use the in-store credit."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Once the second order determined that the in-store credit has already been used, it would roll back the transaction."
    - content: "One order would be processed and use the in-store credit, and the other order would update the remaining inventory for the items in the basket, but would not complete the order."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Once the second order determined that the in-store credit has already been used, it would roll back the transaction."
    - content: "One order would be processed and use the in-store credit, and the other order would not be processed."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Once the second order determined that the in-store credit has already been used, it would roll back the transaction."
