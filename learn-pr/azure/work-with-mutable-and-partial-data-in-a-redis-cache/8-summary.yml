  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: "What happens if a command in a Redis transaction fails?"
    choices:
    - content: If a command is queued with incorrect syntax, the transaction will be automatically discarded if you try to execute it. If a command fails during execution, the transaction will complete as normal.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "In Redis, commands that fail during execution do not stop a transaction. Commands queued with incorrect syntax will prevent the transaction from being executed."
    - content: Commands prior to the failing command will still be executed, but those after the failing command will not be.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A failing command in a transaction will not prevent later commands from being executed."
    - content: The entire transaction will be rolled back.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Redis does not support transaction rollbacks."
    - content: The connection will be aborted.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Failed commands do not cause a Redis connection to be aborted."

  - content: "Which of the following is a Redis command for managing data expiration?"
    choices:
    - content: "DEL"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "DEL is used to delete keys."
    - content: "DISCARD"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "DISCARD is used to cancel a transaction prior to its execution."
    - content: "TIMEOUT"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "TIMEOUT is not a valid Redis command."
    - content: "EXPIRE"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "EXPIRE is used to set the expiration timeout of a key in seconds."

  - content: "Your Redis cache is configured with the **volatile-ttl** eviction policy. If it runs out of memory and you try to insert a new key, which existing key is removed?"
    choices:
    - content: "The least recently used key."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is the behavior of the **allkeys-lru** eviction policy."
    - content: "A random key."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is the behavior of the **allkeys-random** policy."
    - content: "The key that would next expire."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "**volatile-ttl** removes the key with the shortest time-to-live."
    - content: "A random key, selected from keys that have been configured to expire."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is the behavior of the **volatile-random** policy."
