  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What are the key steps required to set up Azure Site Recovery to protect your on-premises VMs?"
    choices:
    - content: Central management, on-premises virtual machine replication, network integration, app consistency during failover
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: These are all the features of Azure Site Recovery, not the steps you need to take.
    - content: Networking, create a Recovery Services vault, give the correct permissions to credentials, install a configuration server in your vCenter via an OVA
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Correct, all of the above are needed to set up Azure Site Recovery correctly.
    - content: Protected Items, Replicated Item, Compute & Network, use an existing Recovery Services vault, Test Failover
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: These are properties you'll see in the Azure portal, not the steps you need to take.
  - content: "How should you test the Azure Site Recovery deployment?"
    choices:
    - content: Run a disaster recovery drill for all the protected VMs, on the production network.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This would adversely affect the performance of all the live workloads.
    - content: Run a disaster recovery drill for a single isolated VM, on the production network.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: Running on an isolated VM is best practice, but you should use an isolated network to ensure live services aren't affected.
    - content: Run a disaster recovery drill for a single isolated VM, on an isolated network.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: Proving the recovery on a single VM, on an isolated network, ensures that live services aren't affected and proves the recoveries are set up correctly.
