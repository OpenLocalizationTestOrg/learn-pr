Suppose you're an administrator for an organization that's developing autonomous vehicles. These vehicles can generate from 5 terabytes (TB) to 20 TB of telemetry data every day. The organization needs to keep this data for research and legal purposes. You decide to store the data in Azure Blob storage. But you need an easy, secure, and relatively inexpensive way to regularly import the data to Azure without tying up network bandwidth.

In this module, you'll learn how to use the Azure Data Box family to import terabytes of data into an Azure storage account.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you'll:

- Decide which Azure Data Box device to use
- Learn the steps to import data by using Azure Data Box Disk
