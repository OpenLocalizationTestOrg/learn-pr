Companies that publish web APIs often need to control the behavior of those APIs without recoding them.

Suppose you are the lead developer for a government agency. The agency has created an API to make recent and historical census data available. They want to prevent any unnecessary back-end information from being exposed that could be used in malicious attacks. They would also like to prevent abuse of the APIs in the form of a large volume of requests and need a mechanism to throttle requests if they exceed an allowed amount. They are serving their APIs on the Azure API Management service and would like to implement policies to address these concerns.

Azure API Management enables a consistent, modern, and secure gateway for all your web APIs. It offers policies to manage security through configuration.

In this module, you'll create an API gateway to publish a RESTful API. You will remove response headers, replace URLs, and throttle requests to achieve a secure endpoint for clients to communicate with.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Create an Azure API gateway
- Import a RESTful API into the gateway
- Implement policies to secure and throttle the requests
- Call an API to test the applied policies

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with basic concepts of web APIs, such as operations and endpoints
