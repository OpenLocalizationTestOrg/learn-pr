In this module, you learned how to use Traffic Manager as a DNS load balancer to distribute traffic to different web apps deployed in different regions to:

- Improve performance by serving requests from the closest deployment.
- Direct traffic to specific endpoints through priority routing.
- Improve application resilience by detecting failures and routing customers to available endpoints.
- Perform maintenance or updates without any downtime.
- Serve requests from specific geographic locations from specific deployments.

You can now use Traffic manager to improve your availability and global distribution of your application, which improves customer experience.
