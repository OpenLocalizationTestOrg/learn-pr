As a PostgreSQL user, you may already know the benefits of PostgreSQL. You plan to use **Azure Database for PostgreSQL** and you want to make sure you'll have access to the same benefits as your on-premises server before moving to the cloud.

Azure Database for PostgreSQL is a relational database service in the Microsoft cloud. The server software is based on the community version of the open-source PostgreSQL database engine. Your familiarity with tools and expertise with PostgreSQL is applicable when using Azure Database for PostgreSQL.

Moreover, Azure Database for PostgreSQL delivers the following benefits:

- Built-in high availability compared to on-premises resources. There is no additional configuration, replication, or cost required to make sure your applications are always available.
- Simple and flexible pricing. You have predictable performance based on a selected pricing tier choice that includes software patching, automatic backups, monitoring, and security.
- Scale up or down as needed within seconds. You can scale compute or storage independently as needed, to make sure you adapt your service to match usage.
- Adjustable automatic backups and point-in-time-restore for up to 35 days.
- Enterprise-grade security and compliance to protect sensitive data at-rest and in-motion that covers data encryption on disk and SSL encryption between client and server communication.

These benefits should help make your decision to go from on-premises PostgreSQL to Azure Database for PostgreSQL simple.
