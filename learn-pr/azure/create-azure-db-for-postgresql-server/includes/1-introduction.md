Suppose you work for a company that processes fitness tracker data for runners. Your company tracks the runners' routes and performance using a relational database hosted on an on-premises server.

The company wants to expand by tracking additional fitness tracking models and types. To do the expansion, the company will need to scale its database for both capacity and performance. You want to move away from your current on-premises database servers without compromising security.

When you consider cloud-hosted database offerings, some of the questions that you may have might be aspects like availability, scalability, and security. Azure Database for PostgreSQL allows you to take advantage of built-in security, fault tolerance, and data protection that you otherwise have to buy or design separately, build, and manage.

## Learning objectives

By the end of thisâ€¯module, you will:

- Create an Azure Database for PostgreSQL using the Azure portal
