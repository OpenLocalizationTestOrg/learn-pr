Suppose you're the network architect at a regional healthcare provider. The organization has migrated much of its infrastructure to Azure. You'd like to connect your datacenter and larger regional facilities to Azure. You need secure connectivity so that patient health information is protected while it's crossing the network. You don't currently have the bandwidth requirements for a dedicated circuit, and you're looking for a way to integrate these networks in a cost-effective way.

The virtual private network (VPN) gateway options in Azure can help your company meet these connectivity requirements. You'll see how this is done by creating and testing VPNs to securely connect sites to Azure.
