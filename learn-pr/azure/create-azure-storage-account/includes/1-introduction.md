Most organizations have diverse requirements for their cloud-hosted data. For example, storing data in a specific region,or needing separate billing for different data categories. Azure storage accounts let you formalize these types of policies and apply them to your Azure data.

Suppose you work at a chocolate manufacturer that produces baking ingredients such as cocoa powder and chocolate chips. You market your products to grocery stores who then sell them to consumers.

Your formulations and manufacturing processes are trade secrets. The spreadsheets, documents, and instructional videos that capture this information are critical to your business and require geographically-redundant storage. This data is primarily accessed from your main factory, so you would like to store it in a nearby datacenter. The expense for this storage needs to be billed to the manufacturing department.

You also have a sales group that creates cookie recipes and baking videos to promote your products to consumers. Your priority for this data is low cost, rather than redundancy or location. This storage must be billed to the sales team.

Here, you will see how to handle these types of business requirements by creating multiple Azure storage accounts. Each storage account will have the appropriate settings for the data it holds.
