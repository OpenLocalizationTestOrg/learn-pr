Big data applications should have the ability to process increased throughput by scaling out to meet increased transaction volumes.

Suppose you work in the credit card department of a bank. You're part of a team that manages the system responsible for fraud testing to determine whether to approve or decline each transaction. Your system receives a stream of transactions and needs to process them in real time.

The load on your system can spike during weekends and holidays. It should be able to handle increased throughput efficiently and accurately. Given the sensitive nature of the transactions, even the slightest error can have a huge impact.

Azure Event Hubs can receive and process large number of transactions. It can also be configured to scale dynamically, when required, to handle increased throughput.
In this module, youâ€™ll learn how to connect Event Hubs to your application and reliably process huge transaction volumes.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Create an Event Hub using the Azure CLI.
- Configure applications to send or receive messages through an Event Hub.
- Evaluate Event Hub performance using the Azure portal.
