Imagine you are the server administrator for a regional fire department (RFD) covering dozens of stations. Your department has recently migrated their on-premises systems to the cloud; specifically, they've migrated existing servers to virtual machines hosted in Azure. The department has public-facing and private websites supporting email, patient records, and internal applications.
