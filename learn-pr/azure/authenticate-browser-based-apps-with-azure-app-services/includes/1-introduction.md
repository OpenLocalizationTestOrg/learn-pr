Imagine you are the web administrator for a fashion retailer. The company has a range of brands that appeal to different markets, and each brand has its own web site. At present, each web site is a separate ecommerce operation, and customers have to register on each site using a legacy identity management system that was developed in-house. This system is difficult to deploy, and you'd like to be able to make use of some form of federation, and to take advantage of existing identity providers, such as Microsoft, Facebook, or Google. Most of your potential customers will already have accounts with these providers, so you will no longer have the overhead of supporting your own identity service, with all the technical and legal issues that involves.

Your company also wants to integrate purchases with social media, simplifying the ability of customers to say that they have purchased a specific item and then post a link to that item online. 

As the web administrator, you need to evaluate the authentication features in the Azure App Service, and determine how you would transition to using these services for your online retail sites. 

In this module, you'll look at how to authenticate users using Azure App Services and various providers. You'll focus on the portal configuration, basic authentication flow, how to configure the portal to force authentication and how to specify authentication providers in website code, for application environments such as .NET, Node, and Python. 

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Understand how authentication and authorization is supported in the Azure App Service for use with browser-based apps
- Configure an Authentication Provider for use with browser-based apps
- Use authentication tokens in scripts and application code
- Use Azure tools to limit app access to user information
