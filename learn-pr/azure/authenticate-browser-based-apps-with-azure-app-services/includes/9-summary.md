In this module, you have learned how to integrate third-party and Microsoft authentication methods into Azure web apps published through Azure App Service. You looked at how authentication and authorization work when using browser-based apps, and the role of authentication providers. You enabled an authentication provider, and looked at how web apps can request user information during authentication, and how you can control this behavior. You also looked at the authentication tokens, and how to use logic in your apps to query the state of a user's authentication token.

Using the Azure portal, you saw how simple it can be to implement authentication providers, such as Microsoft, into your web apps. Taking advantage of such dedicated authentication services enables you to focus on your application, and not have to worry about developing and supporting your own identity management and authentication processes.
