  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:

  - content: "Which of the following queues should you use if you need first-in-first-out order and support for transactions?"
    choices:
    - content: 'Azure Service Bus queues'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Azure Service Bus queues handle messages in the same order they're added and also support transactions. This means that if one message in a transaction fails to be added to the queue, all messages in the transaction will not be added."
    - content: 'Azure Storage queues'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Even though a queue is a first-in-first-out data structure, Azure Storage queues do not guarantee it."
    
  - content: "Suppose you're sending a message with Azure Service Bus and you want multiple components to receive it. Which Azure Service Bus exchange feature should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: 'Queue'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A queue can only have one destination component at a time, which means that each message in the queue is delivered to only one receiver."
    - content: 'Topic'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A topic allows multiple destination components to subscribe. This means that each message can be delivered to multiple receivers."
    - content: 'Relay'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A relay is used for two-way communication and it provides bidirectional connections across network boundaries."

  - content: "True or false: you can add a message to an Azure Service Bus queue that is 2 MB in size."
    choices:
    - content: 'True'
      isCorrect: false

    - content: 'False'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "An Azure Service Bus queue message must be larger than 64 KB but smaller than 256 KB."
