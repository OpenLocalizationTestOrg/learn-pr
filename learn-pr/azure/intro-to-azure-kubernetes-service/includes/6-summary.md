Our goal was to help you evaluate whether AKS would be a good choice as a Kubernetes orchestration platform for your business. We looked at several features that enhance the AKS Kubernetes offering. We saw how these features can help you decide if AKS is a good fit for new projects, or convince you to move from another Kubernetes solution, to Azure.

We also saw how AKS makes use of familiar concepts such as:

- The Docker file format for creating containers
- Popular development and management tools such as Helm, Draft, Kubernetes extension for Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio Kubernetes Tools
- Integration with Azure DevOps Projects to simplify setting up a DevOps pipeline for your application

You were looking for a container orchestration platform to quickly deploy your fleet management solution into new customer regions. AKS allows you to manage your hosted Kubernetes environment and makes it simple to develop, deploy, and managed containerized applications in Azure.

You don't need to manage any of the clusters infrastructures and you only pay for what you use. It streamlines the installation process and takes care of most of the underlying cluster management tasks.

Finally, AKS is part of Azure and can be integrated with other Azure services to extend your product or exchange data with other services.
