Organizations are often challenged to build secure applications while minimizing complexity for users. How would you give users secure access to an application to help them do their jobs, without requiring them to remember a new username, password, or other credentials?

Let's assume you work for a transportation company. You're building an application that allows drivers to sign in and manage their schedules. You want to allow users to sign in with their Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) accounts that they currently use for Office 365 so they don't have to create additional accounts. You will configure your application to allow authentication with OpenID Connect and Azure AD.

Learn how OpenID Connect enables users to authenticate with a single account to multiple applications.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Understand the authentication needs of your application.
- Create an Azure AD tenant and configure application registration for your application.
- Deploy an application that uses OpenID Connect and Azure AD to authenticate users.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of C#
- Basic knowledge of Azure AD
