1. **Introduction**

    You work for a transportation company and are building an application that allows drivers to log in and manage their schedules. You want to allow users to log in with their Azure AD accounts that they currently use for Office 365 so they don't have to create additional accounts. You need to configure your application to allow authentication with OpenID Connect.

1. **Modern authentication for your application**

    > [!NOTE]
    > Make sure to provide really good contextual information here. Modern authentication is complex and often misunderstood. Diagrams of how things work can be really valuable here as well, so be sure to include them

   - Authentication scenarios in Azure Active Directory
       - Example scenarios and details of it's relevance
   - OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0
       - Features and concepts using this for authentication
   - Understanding Office 365 Identity and AD
       - Features and concepts using this for cloud authentication

   - Quick knowledge check quiz:
       - In which of the following scenarios would OpenID Connect be the best option?
       - What different modern app architectures are supported by Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication?

1. **Create an Azure AD tenant and configure application registration for your application**

    - To get started, you will need access to an environment, also called an Azure AD tenant, that can register and manage apps, have access to Microsoft 365 data etc
    - Integrate an application with the Azure Active Directory, register the applicationâ€™s details with the active directory in the Azure portal. To do this, need to first create an Azure Active Directory tenant - This will give an Application ID for the application, as well as enable it to receive tokens (Check the upper right corner. If you have a tenant, you'll automatically be logged in and can see the tenant name directly under your account name.)

    In order to demonstrate this integration of Azure AD using OpenID Connect we will clone a sample MVC web application that uses OpenID connect to sign in users from a single Azure AD tenant. Run the app and then Click the sign-in link on the homepage of the application to sign in. On the Azure AD sign-in page, enter the name and password of a user account that is in your Azure AD tenant.

    So, you require the following:
    - Azure AD tenant
    - A user account in the Azure AD tenant
    - A cloned Web App to deploy
    - The cloned Web App must be registered with the Azure AD tenant

1. **Exercise - Create an Azure AD tenant and configure application registration for your application**

    Complete the steps for this exercise by using Cloud Shell, its code editor and the Azure CLI.

    Use Azure CLI commands to create a user (i.e. az ad sp create-for-rbac --name ServicePrincipalName --password <Choose a strong password>)

    Steps to create tenant and configure app.

    1. Login to the Azure Portal
    1. Select Create a resource, select Identity, and then select Azure Active Directory
    1. Enter an Organization name, Initial domain name and Select the Country or region from the dropdown
    1. Once created, locally clone a sample .NET app from GitHub. Similar to https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-webapp-openidconnect
    1. On the top bar, click on your account and under the Directory list, choose the Active Directory tenant where you wish to register your application.
    1. Click on All services in the left-hand nav, and choose Azure Active Directory.
    1. In the Azure Active Directory pane, click on App registrations and choose New application registration.
    1. Enter a friendly name for the application, for example 'WebApp-OpenIDConnect-DotNet' and select 'Web app / API' as the Application Type.
    1. For the sign-on URL, enter the base URL for the sample. By default, this sample uses https://localhost:44320/.
    1. Click Create to create the application.
    1. In the succeeding page, Find the Application ID value and record it for later. You'll need it to configure the Visual Studio configuration file for this project.
    1. Then click on Settings, and choose Properties.
    1. For the App ID URI, replace the guid in the generated URI 'https://<your_tenant_name>/<guid>', with the name of your service, for example, 'https://<your_tenant_name>/WebApp-OpenIDConnect-DotNet' (replacing <your_tenant_name> with the name of your Azure AD tenant)
    1. From the Settings | Reply URLs page for your application, update the Reply URL for the application to be https://localhost:44320/
    1. Configure Permissions for your application. To that extent, in the Settings menu, choose the 'Required permissions' section and then, click on Add, then Select an API, and type Windows Azure Active Directory in the textbox. Then, click on Select Permissions and select User.Read.

    In the following steps, the student may need the tenant name (directory name) or the tenant ID (directory ID). These are in the Properties of the Azure Active Directory window, listed as Name and Directory ID.

    - To obtain these details:
      1. Hover over your account name to get the directory / tenant ID, or
      1. Select Azure Active Directory > Properties > Directory ID in the Azure portal

    In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

      1. Open the solution in the Cloud Shell code editor to configure the projects
      1. Open the WebApp-OpenIDConnect-DotNet\Web.Config file
      1. Find the app key ida:Tenant and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant name.
      1. Find the app key ida:ClientId and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of the  WebApp-OpenIDConnect-DotNet application copied from the Azure portal.

    If you changed the base URL of the sample, find the app key ida:PostLogoutRedirectUri and replace the value with the new base URL of the sample.

1. **Exercise - Deploy an application that uses OpenID Connect to authenticate users**

    1. In the Cloud Shell run the following:
        - Create a web app (name something like : WebApp-OpenIDConnect-DotNet-contoso.azurewebsites.net)
            - az webapp create --name $webappname --resource-group myResourceGroup \--plan $webappname
    1. You should see the application deployed in Azure portal, click on it to manage it.
    1. Click on Settings and in the Connection tab, update the Destination URL so that it is https, for example https://WebApp-OpenIDConnect-DotNet-contoso.azurewebsites.net. Click Next.
    1. Run the web app by opening a browser to the URL of the project
    1. Click the sign-in link on the homepage of the application to sign in. On the Azure AD sign-in page, enter the name and password of a user account that is in your Azure AD tenant.

1. **Summary**

   - Explored the OpenID Connect concepts for authentication
   - Created and deployed an application that uses OpenID Connect to authenticate users

## Notes

- This sample shows how to use the OpenID Connect ASP.Net OWIN middleware to sign in users from a single Azure AD tenant. The middleware is initialized in the Startup.Auth.cs file, by passing it the Client ID of the application and the URL of the Azure AD tenant where the application is registered. The middleware then takes care of:
- Downloading the Azure AD metadata
- Processing OpenID Connect sign-in responses
- Integrating with the session cookie
