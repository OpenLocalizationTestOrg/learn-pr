In this unit, you will use developer tools to create the code for a starter web application.

## Create a new web project

::: zone pivot="csharp"

The heart of the .NET CLI tools is the `dotnet` command line tool. Using this command, you will create a new ASP.NET Core web project.

In the Cloud Shell on the right, create a new ASP.NET Core MVC application. Name it "BestBikeApp".

```bash
dotnet new mvc --name BestBikeApp
```

The command will create a new folder named "BestBikeApp" to hold your project. `cd` there, then build and run the application to verify it is complete.

```bash
cd BestBikeApp
dotnet run
```

You should get something like:

```console
Hosting environment: Development
Content root path: /home/your-user/BestBikeApp
Now listening on: https://localhost:5001
Now listening on: http://localhost:5000
Application started.
```

The output describes the situation after starting your app: the application is running and listening at port 5000.

If we were running the app on our own machine, we'd be able to open a browser to http://localhost:5000 and see our site. To make this accessible from outside of our own machine, we'll need to deploy the app to somewhere with a public endpoint. The App Service instance we created earlier is perfect for that.

Press <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> to shut down the running app.

::: zone pivot="node"

To create a starter Node.js web application, we'll use Node Package Manager (`npm`) along with some basic JavaScript code to run the actual web page processing.

Run these commands in the Cloud Shell now to create a new `package.json` which will describe our Node.js application.

```console
cd ~
mkdir helloworld
cd helloworld
npm init -y
```

This will create a new `package.json` file in the current folder - you should see it in the current folder if you type `ls` in the terminal window. We will need a JavaScript file to run our website logic - since this is just a basic example, we will only need one file - `index.js`. Use the following command in the terminal to create the file:

```bash
touch index.js
```

Now we have to make a few edits to both of our files. Type the following command into the terminal to open an interactive editor.

```console
code .
```

Select the `package.json` file and make the following edits to the `scripts` section to use Node.js to launch the web app. You can also remove the `main` entry.

```json
{
  "name": "helloworld",
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
  ...
}
```

Save the file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Whenever you paste or change code into a file in the editor, make sure to save afterwards using the "..." menu, or the accelerator key (<kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd> on Windows and Linux, <kbd>Command+S</kbd> on macOS).

Switch to the `index.js` file and add the following contents to it. This is a simple node program to always respond with "Hello World!" when any GET request is made to the server.

```javascript
var http = require('http');

var server = http.createServer(function(request, response) {

    response.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/html" });
    response.end("<html><h1>Hello World!</h1></html>");

});

var port = process.env.PORT || 1337;
server.listen(port);

console.log("Server running at http://localhost:%d", port);
```

Save the file and exit the editor. You can exit the editor through the "..." menu on the top right or through <kbd>Ctrl+Q</kbd>.

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="java"

To create a starter web application, we'll use Maven, a commonly-used project management and build tool for Java apps. Maven includes a feature called *archetypes* that can quickly create starter code for different kinds of applications. We can use the `maven-archetype-webapp` template to generate the code for a simple web app that displays "Hello World!" on its homepage.

Run these commands in the Cloud Shell now to create a new web app:

```console
cd ~
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=example.demo -DartifactId=helloworld -DinteractiveMode=false -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp
```

Now, run these commands to change to the new "helloworld" application directory and package the application for deployment:

```console
cd helloworld
mvn package
```

When the command finishes running, if you change to the `target` directory and run `ls`, you'll see a file listed called `helloworld.war`. This is the web application package that we will deploy to App Service.
