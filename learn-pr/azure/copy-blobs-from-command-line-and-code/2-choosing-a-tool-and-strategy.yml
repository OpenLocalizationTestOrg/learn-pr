  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "You want to quickly upload the data in a collection of small files held in a local folder to blob storage. This is a one-off request. You don't want to overwrite blobs that have been modified in the last two days. Which tool should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure CLI"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: The Azure CLI is great choice for one-off file transfers and can be used to check the last modified date."
    - content: "AzCopy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No: The AzCopy command doesn't support checking the last modified time of a blob before overwriting it."
    - content: ".NET Storage Client library"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No: This is a one-off task. It isn't worth the time and development effort to build a custom application."
  - content: "You want to transfer a series of large files to blob storage. It may take several hours to upload each file, and you're concerned that if a transfer fails it shouldn't have to restart from the beginning. Which tool is the most appropriate to do this task?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure CLI"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No. The Azure CLI doesn't provide a way to resume a failed transfer."
    - content: "AzCopy"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct: AzCopy is ideal for transferring large files as it can run in the background and you can monitor the status AzCopy jobs."
    - content: "The .NET Client Storage library."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You could write your own custom application for this task, but the AzCopy utility already provides the features you require."
  - content: "You want to move a set of blobs in Azure storage from one storage account to another. You want to organize the blobs in the destination account in different folders, according to the month in which each blob was last updated. You'll be performing this task at regular intervals. Which tool should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure CLI"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No: The Azure CLI doesn't provide a simple way to reorganize blobs in this way."
    - content: "AzCopy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "No: AzCopy doesn't provide a simple way to reorganize blobs in this way."
