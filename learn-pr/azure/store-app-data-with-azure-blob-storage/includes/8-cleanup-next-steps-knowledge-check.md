In this module, you learned how to use Azure Blob storage to store web application data. We discussed tips for creating a strategy to use Blob storage in a web app and how to use the Azure Storage SDK for .NET Core to write to and read from blobs. The app we made accepts uploaded files from users, stores them in Blob storage, and makes them available for download.
