Securing your Azure resources, such as virtual machines, websites, networks, and storage, is a critical function for any organization using the cloud. You want to ensure that your data and assets are protected, but still grant your employees and partners the access they need to perform their jobs. Role-based access control (RBAC) is an authorization system in Azure that helps you manage who has access to Azure resources, what they can do with those resources, and where they have access.

As an example, suppose you work for First Up Consultants, which is an engineering firm that specializes in circuit and electrical design. They've moved their workloads and assets to Azure to make collaboration easier across several offices and other companies. You work in the IT department at First Up Consultants, where you are responsible for keeping the company's assets secure, but still allowing users to access the resources they need. You've heard that RBAC can help you manage resources in Azure.

In this module, you will learn how to use role-based access control (RBAC) to manage access to resources in Azure.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Verify access to resources for yourself and others
