    With _serverless_ computing, Azure takes care of managing the server infrastructure and allocation/deallocation of resources based on demand. Infrastructure isn't your responsibility. Scaling and performance are handled automatically, and you are billed only for the exact resources you use. There's no need to even reserve capacity.

    You focus solely on the logic you need to execute and the _trigger_ that is used to run your code. You configure your serverless apps to respond to _events_. This could be a REST endpoint, a periodic timer, or even a message received from another Azure service. The serverless app runs only when it's triggered by an event.

#### Serverless computing in Azure

> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RE2yzjL]

Azure has two implementations of serverless compute:

- **Azure Functions** which can execute code in almost any modern language.
- **Azure Logic Apps** which are designed in a web-based designer and can execute logic triggered by Azure services without writing any code.

## Azure Functions

When you're concerned only about the code running your service, and not the underlying platform or infrastructure, Azure Functions are ideal. They're commonly used when you need to perform work in response to an event, often via a REST request, timer, or message from another Azure service and when that work can be completed quickly, within seconds or less. 

Azure Functions scale automatically based on demand, so they're a solid choice when demand is variable. For example, you may be receiving messages from an IoT solution used to monitor a fleet of delivery vehicles. You'll likely have more data arriving during business hours.

Using a VM-based approach, you'd incur costs even when the VM is idle. With functions, Azure runs your code when it's triggered and automatically deallocates resources when the function is finished. In this model, you're only charged for the CPU time used while your function runs.  

Furthermore, Azure Functions can be either stateless (the default) where they behave as if they're restarted every time they respond to an event), or stateful (called "Durable Functions") where a context is passed through the function to track prior activity.

## Azure Logic Apps

Azure Logic Apps are similar to Functions - both enable you to trigger logic based on an event. Where Functions execute code, Logic Apps execute _workflows_ built from predefined logic blocks. They are specifically designed to automate your business processes.

You create Logic App workflows using a visual designer on the Azure Portal or in Visual Studio. The workflows are persisted as a JSON file with a known workflow schema.

Azure provides over 200 different connectors and processing blocks to interact with different services - including most popular enterprise apps. You can also build custom connectors and workflow steps if the service you need to interact with isn't covered. You then use the visual designer to link connectors and blocks together, passing data through the workflow to do custom processing - often all without writing any code.

As an example, let's say a ticket arrives in ZenDesk. You could:

1. Detect the intent of the message with cognitive services
1. Create an item in Sharepoint to track the issue
1. If the customer isn't in your database, add them to your Dynamics 365 CRM system
1. Send a follow-up email to acknowledge their request

All of that could be designed in a visual designer making it easy to see the logic flow which is ideal for a business analyst role.

## Functions vs. Logic Apps

Functions and Logic Apps can both create complex orchestrations. An orchestration is a collection of functions or steps, that are executed to accomplish a complex task. With Azure Functions, you write code to complete each step, with Logic Apps, you use a GUI to define the actions and how they relate to one another.

You can mix and match services when you build an orchestration, calling functions from logic apps and calling logic apps from functions. Here are some common differences between the two.

|-| Functions |    Logic Apps |
|-|-------------------|------------|
| State | Normally stateless, but Durable Functions provide state | Stateful |
| Development | Code-first (imperative) | Designer-first (declarative) |
| Connectivity | About a dozen built-in binding types, write code for custom bindings | Large collection of connectors, Enterprise Integration Pack for B2B scenarios, build custom connectors |
| Actions | Each activity is an Azure function; write code for activity functions | Large collection of ready-made actions |
| Monitoring | Azure Application Insights | Azure portal, Log Analytics |
| Management | REST API, Visual Studio | Azure portal, REST API, PowerShell, Visual Studio |
| Execution context | Can run locally or in the cloud | Runs only in the cloud. |
