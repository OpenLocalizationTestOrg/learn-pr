Azure App Service enables you to build and host web apps, background jobs, mobile backends, and RESTful APIs in the programming language of your choice without managing infrastructure. It offers auto-scaling and high availability, supports both Windows and Linux, and enables automated deployments from GitHub, Azure DevOps, or any Git repo to support a continuous deployment model.

This platform as a service (PaaS) allows you to focus on the website and API logic while Azure takes care of the infrastructure to run and scale your web applications. 

## App Service costs

You pay for the Azure compute resources your app uses while it processes requests based on the App Service Plan you choose. The App Service plan determines how much hardware is devoted to your host - for example, whether it's dedicated or shared hardware, and how much memory is reserved for it. There is even a _free_ tier you can use to host small, low-traffic sites.

## Types of web apps

With Azure App Service, you can host most common web app styles including:

- Web Apps
- API Apps
- WebJobs
- Mobile Apps

Azure App Service handles most of the infrastructure decisions you deal with in hosting web apps: deployment and management are integrated into the platform, endpoints can be secured, sites can be scaled quickly to handle high traffic loads, and the built-in load balancing and traffic manager provide high availability. All of these app styles are hosted in the same infrastructure and share these benefits. This makes App Service the ideal choice to host web-oriented applications.

### Web Apps

App Service includes full support for hosting web apps using ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, or Python. You can choose either Windows or Linux as the host operating system. 

### API Apps

Much like hosting a website, you can build REST-based Web APIs using your choice of language and framework. You get full Swagger support, and the ability to package and publish your API in the Azure Marketplace. The produced apps can be consumed from any HTTP(s) based client.

### Web Jobs

WebJobs allows you to run a program (.exe, Java, PHP, Python or Node.js) or script (.cmd, .bat, PowerShell, or Bash) in the same context as a web app, API app, or mobile app. They can be scheduled, or run by a trigger. This is often used to run background tasks as part of your application logic.

### Mobile Apps

Use the Mobile Apps feature of Azure App Service to quickly build a back-end for iOS and Android apps. With just a few clicks in the Azure portal you can:

- Store mobile app data in a cloud-based SQL database
- Authenticate customers against common social providers such as MSA, Google, Twitter and Facebook
- Send push notifications
- Execute custom back-end logic in C# or Node.js

On the mobile app side, there is SDK support for native iOS & Android, Xamarin, and React native apps.
