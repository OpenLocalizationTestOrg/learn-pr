    title: Check your knowledge
    questions:

    - content: "Suppose you have an existing application running locally on your own server. You need additional capacity but prefer to move to Azure instead of buying upgraded on-premises hardware. Which compute option would likely give you the quickest route to getting your application running in Azure?"
      choices:
      - content: "Serverless computing"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Converting to a serverless computing model would likely require reorganizing your application to an event-based architecture."
      - content: "Containers"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Converting to containers would require you to repackage your application. This might not be too difficult depending on your existing architecture, but it would take time and require some expertise with containers."
      - content: "Virtual machines"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "You have full control over the VM setup, so you can configure it to match your on-premises server. This will allow your existing application to run on the Azure VM with little or no change."

    - content: "Imagine that you work on a photo-sharing application that runs on millions of mobile devices. Demand is unpredictable because you see a spike in usage whenever a locally or nationally significant event occurs. Which Azure compute resource is the best match for this workload?"
      choices:
      - content: "Serverless computing"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "The photo-sharing app is event driven and needs to handle unpredictable demand. Serverless computing is a good fit for this because it is event based and can scale instantly to process spikes in traffic. It should also be a cost-effective choice because you will pay for compute time only when processing user data."
      - content: "Containers"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The startup time for a container instance is typically a few seconds. This might not provide quick enough scaling to respond to a sharp spike in demand."
      - content: "Virtual machines"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "A VM can take a few minutes to start. This might not provide quick enough scaling to respond to a sharp spike in demand."

    - content: "The compute options give you different levels of control over the configuration of the environment in which your application runs. Which of the following lists the compute options in order from \"most control\" to \"least control\"?"
      choices:
      - content: "Serverless computing, containers, virtual machines"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Serverless computing gives you the least control; it completely abstracts the underlying hosting environment."
      - content: "Containers, serverless computing, virtual machines"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Containers give you limited control over the environment; for example, you choose the underlying operating system."
      - content: "Virtual machines, containers, serverless computing"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Virtual machines give you full control over the environment. Containers give you limited control. Serverless computing does not allow you to do any infrastructure configuration."
