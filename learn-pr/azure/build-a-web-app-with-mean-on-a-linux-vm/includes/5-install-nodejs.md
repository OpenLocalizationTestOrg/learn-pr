Here you'll install Node.js, the **N** in the MEAN acronym. Like MongoDB, Node.js is open source. 

Node.js will act as the server-side host for your web application and handle inbound HTTP traffic. Node.js also provides you with a way to communicate with your MongoDB installation, which you'll see later.

## What versions of Node.js are available?

You can get Node.js in two ways:

- **Long Term Support (LTS)** - LTS is generally considered to be more stable and is recommended for most users and for production environments.
- **Current** - Current is for those who want to experiment with the latest features. Because it can introduce breaking changes between releases, it's not recommended for production environments.

Here you'll use Node.js LTS.

## How do I install Node.js?

Like MongoDB, you can run Node.js on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Node.js also supports Unix-based operating systems such as SunOS and AIX.

Just as with MongoDB, here you'll register the Node.js repository so that `apt` can locate the package.

Recall that you're working with an Ubuntu VM. Later, you can [check out the installation guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager?azure-portal=true) to learn how to install Node.js on your favorite platform.

## Install Node.js

Here you'll install Node.js. As with MongoDB, the process involves registering the Node.js repository so that `apt` can locate the package.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Here, you'll work from the SSH connection to the Ubuntu VM that you created earlier in this module.

1. Register the Node.js repository so the package manager can locate the packages, like this.

    ```bash
    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
    ```

1. Install the Node.js package.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install -y Node.js
    ```

1. Run `node -v` to verify the installation.

    ```bash
    node -v
    ```

    The output shows that you have the latest LTS version of Node.js.

## Exit your SSH session

You're all done working directly on the VM for now. Run `exit` to leave the SSH session to your VM.

```bash
exit
```

You're now back at your Cloud Shell session.
