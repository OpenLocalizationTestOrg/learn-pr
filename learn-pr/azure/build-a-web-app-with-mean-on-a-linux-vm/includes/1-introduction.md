You're a software developer at an online retail store that specializes in children's books. You're building a new web site for your business. You haven't yet fully defined the exact needs for your site, but you'll be responsible for the site from start to finish. You have lots of experience in JavaScript, so you want to find a solution that plays well to your strengths.

You've heard about the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js) and you know it uses JavaScript. So you decide to try it out by building a MEAN stack and a basic web application that stores information about books. You can use what you learned to get a jump-start on your new web site.

- Decide if the MEAN web stack is right for you
- Create an Ubuntu Linux VM to host your web app
- Install the MEAN stack components on your VM
- Create a basic web app on your MEAN stack
