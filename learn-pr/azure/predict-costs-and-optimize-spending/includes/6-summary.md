We've talked through the Azure pricing calculator and how you can use it to estimate your costs on Azure and compare pricing between different service offerings. We looked at savings options, how to export pricing estimates, and at tools that Azure has available to help you keep your cloud spend in check.

- Azure Cost Management gives you reporting and billing information, so you can gain insights into where you're spending your money.

We then explored best practices to help you save money on both infrastructure and licensing.
