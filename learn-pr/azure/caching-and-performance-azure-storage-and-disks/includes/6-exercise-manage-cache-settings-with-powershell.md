In the previous exercise, we performed the following tasks using the Azure portal:

- View OS disk cache status
- Change the cache settings of the OS disk
- Add a data disk to the VM
- Change caching type on a new data disk

Let's practice these operations using Azure PowerShell. 

> [!NOTE]
> We're going to use Azure PowerShell, but you could also use the Azure CLI, which provides similar functionality as a console-based tool. It runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows. If you are interested in learning more about the Azure CLI, check out the **Manage Virtual Machines with the Azure CLI** module.

We're going to use the VM we created in the previous exercise. The operations in this lab assume:

- Our VM exists and is called **fotoshareVM**
- Our VM lives in a resource group called **<rgn>[sandbox resource group name]</rgn>**

If you've gone with a different set of names, replace these values with yours.

Here's the current state of our VM disks from the last exercise:

We used the portal to set the **HOST CACHING** field for both the OS and data disks. Keep this initial state in mind as we work through the following steps.

### Set up some variables

First, let's store some resource names so we can use them later.

1. Use the Azure Cloud Shell terminal on the right to run the following PowerShell commands:

    > [!NOTE]
    > Switch your Cloud Shell session to **PowerShell** before trying these commands, if it isn't already.
    
    ```powershell
    $myRgName = "<rgn>[sandbox resource group name]</rgn>"
    $myVMName = "fotoshareVM"
    ```
    
    > [!TIP]
    > You'll have to set these variables again if your Cloud Shell session times out. So, if possible, work through this entire lab in a single session.
    
### Get info about our VM

1. Run the following command to get the properties of our VM:

    ```powershell
    $myVM = Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $myRgName -VMName $myVmName
    ```
    
1. We store the response in our `$myVM` variable. We can pipe the output into the `select-object` cmdlet to filter the display to specific properties:

    ```powershell
    $myVM | select-object -property ResourceGroupName, Name, Type, Location
    ```
    
1. You should get something like the following.

    ```powershell
    ResourceGroupName Name        Type                              Location
    ----------------- ----        ----                              --------
    <rgn>[sandbox resource group name]</rgn> fotoshareVM Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines eastus
    ```
    
### View OS disk cache status

1. We can check the caching  setting through  the `StorageProfile` object, as follows:

    ```powershell
    $myVM.StorageProfile.OsDisk.Caching
    ```

    ```output
    ReadOnly
    ```
   
1. Let's change it back to the default for an OS disk, which is _ReadWrite_.

### Change the cache settings of the OS disk

1. We can set the value for the cache type using the same `StorageProfile` object, as follows:

    ```powershell
    $myVM.StorageProfile.OsDisk.Caching = "ReadWrite"
    ```
    
    This command runs fast, which should tell you it's doing something locally. The command only changes the property on the `myVM` object. As the following screenshot shows, if you refresh the `$myVM` variable by reassigning it using the `Get-AzVM` cmdlet, the caching value won't have changed on the VM.

1. To make the change on the VM itself, call `Update-AzVM`, as follows:

    ```powershell
    Update-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $myRGName -VM $myVM
    ```
    
    Notice that this call takes a while to complete. That's because we're updating the actual VM and Azure restarts the VM  to make the change.

    ```output
    RequestId IsSuccessStatusCode StatusCode ReasonPhrase
    --------- ------------------- ---------- ------------
                             True         OK OK
    ```
    
1. If you refresh the `$myVM` variable again, you'll see the change on the object. Looking at the disk in the portal, you'd also see the change there. 

    ```powershell
    $myVM = Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $myRgName -VMName $myVmName
    $myVM.StorageProfile.OsDisk.Caching
    ```
    
    ```output
    ReadWrite
    ```
    
### List data disk info

1. To see what data disks we have on our VM, run the following command:

    ```powershell
    $myVM.StorageProfile.DataDisks
    ```
    
    ```output
    Name            : fotoshareVM-data
    DiskSizeGB      : 1023
    Lun             : 0
    Caching         : ReadOnly
    CreateOption    : Attach
    SourceImage     :
    VirtualHardDisk :
    ```
    
We have only one data disk at the moment. The `Lun` field is important. It's the unique **L**ogical **U**nit **N**umber. When we add another data disk, we'll give it a unique `Lun` value.

### Add a new data disk to our VM

1. For convenience, we'll store our new disk name:

    ```powershell
    $newDiskName = "fotoshareVM-data2"
    ```
    
1. Run the following `Add-AzVMDataDisk` command to define a new empty 1 GB data disk:

    ```powershell
    Add-AzVMDataDisk -VM $myVM -Name $newDiskName  -LUN 1  -DiskSizeinGB 1 -CreateOption Empty
    ```
    You'll get a response like:

    ```powershell
    ResourceGroupName  : xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxx
    Id                 : /subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-xxxxxxx/resourceGroups/<rgn>[sandbox resource group name]</rgn>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/fotoshareVM
    VmId               : xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxx
    Name               : fotoshareVM
    Type               : Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines
    Location           : eastus
    Tags               : {}
    DiagnosticsProfile : {BootDiagnostics}
    HardwareProfile    : {VmSize}
    NetworkProfile     : {NetworkInterfaces}
    OSProfile          : {ComputerName, AdminUsername, WindowsConfiguration, Secrets}
    ProvisioningState  : Succeeded
    StorageProfile     : {ImageReference, OsDisk, DataDisks}
    ```
    
1. We've given this disk a `Lun` value of `1` because it's not taken. We defined the disk we want to create, so it's time to run `Update-AzVM` to make the actual change:

    ```powershell
    Update-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $myRGName -VM $myVM
    ```
    
1. Let's look at our data disk info again:

    ```powershell
    $myVM.StorageProfile.DataDisks
    ```
    
    ```output
    Name            : fotoshareVM-data
    DiskSizeGB      : 1023
    Lun             : 0
    Caching         : ReadOnly
    CreateOption    : Attach
    SourceImage     :
    VirtualHardDisk :
    
    Name            : fotoshareVM-data2
    DiskSizeGB      : 1
    Lun             : 1
    Caching         : None
    CreateOption    : Empty
    SourceImage     :
    VirtualHardDisk :
    ```

We now have two disks. Our new disk has a `Lun` of `1` and the default value for `Caching` is `None`. Let's change that value.

### Change cache settings of new data disk

1. We modify properties of a virtual machine data disk with the `Set-AzVMDataDisk` cmdlet, as follows:

    ```powershell
    Set-AzVMDataDisk -VM $myVM -Lun "1" -Caching ReadWrite
    ```
    
1. As always, commit the changes with `Update-AzVM`:

    ```powershell
    Update-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $myRGName -VM $myVM
    ```
    
Here's a view from the portal of what we've accomplished in this exercise. Our VM now has two data disks, and we've adjusted all **HOST CACHING** settings. We did all of that with just a few commands. That's the power of Azure PowerShell.
