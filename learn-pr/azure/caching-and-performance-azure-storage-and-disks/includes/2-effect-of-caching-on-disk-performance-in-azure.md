Much like your local computers, virtual machine performance can often be tied directly to how quickly it can read and write data. In order to understand how to improve that performance, we first have to understand how performance is measured and the settings and choices that affect it.

We are looking specifically at the underlying disks and storage used for VMs. When you are looking at performance, keep in mind that you will also have to consider the application layer. For example, if you are running a database in a VM, you will want to look at the performance settings specific to the database to ensure it is optimized for the VM and storage you are running it on.

Let's start by defining a few terms and the guarantees Azure makes about them.

## I/O operations per second

The storage type you select (standard or premium) will decide how fast your disks are. We measure this performance in I/O operations per second, or IOPS (pronounced "eye-ops").

IOPS is number of requests that can be processed by the disk in one second. A single request is a read or write operation. This measurement is applied directly to storage. For example, if you have a disk that can do a **5000 IOPS**, it means that it is theoretically capable of processing 5,000 read and or write operations per second.

IOPS directly affects your application performance. Some applications, such as retail websites, need high IOPS to handle all the small and random I/O requests that must be processed quickly to keep the site responsive.

### IOPS in Azure

When you attach a premium storage disk to your high scale VM, Azure provisions a guaranteed number of IOPS as per the disk specification. For example, a **P50** disk provisions **7500 IOPS**. Each high scale VM size also has a specific IOPS limit that it can sustain. For example, a **Standard GS5** VM has an **80,000 IOPS** limit.

IOPS is a measurement of the storage disks, however it's a _theoretical_ limit - two other factors can affect the actual application performance: **throughput** and **latency**.

### What is throughput?
Throughput (also called "bandwidth") is the amount of data that your application is sending to the storage disks in a specified interval (typically per second). If your application is performing I/O with large blocks of data, it requires high throughput.

Azure provisions throughput in premium storage disks based on that disks' specification. For example, a **P50** disk provisions **250 MB per second** disk throughput. Each high scale VM size also has as specific _throughput limit_ that it can sustain. For example, **Standard GS5** VM has a maximum throughput of **2,000 MB per second**.

#### IOPS vs. throughput

Throughput and IOPS have a direct relationship, changing one will have a direct impact on the other. To get a theoretical limit of throughput you can use the formula: `IOPS x I/O size = throughput`. It's important to consider both of these values when planning your application.

### What is latency?

Reading and writing data takes time. This is where _latency_ comes in. Latency is the time it takes your app to send a request to the disk and get a response. Essentially, latency tells us how long it takes to _process_ a single read or write I/O request.

Latency puts a limit on IOPS. For example, if our disk can handle 5000 IOPS but each operation takes 10 ms to process, then our app will be capped to 100 operation per second due to the processing time. This is a simple example, most of the time latency will be much lower. Ultimately, latency and throughput will determine how fast your app can process data from storage. 

Premium Storage provides consistent low latencies and you can achieve even better latency when necessary through _caching_. 

## Testing your disk performance

You can adjust and balance the IOPS, throughput, and latency of your VM disks by selecting the right VM size and storage type. Typically, the larger or more expensive VM sizes will have higher guarantees for max IOPS and throughput. Add into that equation Standard vs. Premium storage and HDD vs. SSD choices and you have several parameters to play with.

Selecting the right combination involves understanding what your application requirements are. High-I/O applications, such as database servers or online transactional processing systems will require higher IOPS, whereas more computational based applications might get by with much lower requirements. In addition, the _types_ of operations the applications do will affect your throughput. High random access I/O tends to be slower than long sequential reads.

Once you select your configuration, you can use tools such as [Iometer](http://iometer.org/) to test your disk performance on Linux and Windows VMs. This will give you a more real-world sense of what kind of performance to expect. It can also help you to identify ways to improve your app's usage of storage. For example, an application that does single threaded I/O is likely to suffer reduced I/O performance because of latency.

Let's look at some other things we can do to improve our disk performance.
