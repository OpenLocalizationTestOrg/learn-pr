In the example scenario, you've decided to use a scale set to run the web application for the shipping company. Using a scale set, the shipping company can maintain short response times for users as the workload varies.

Your first task is to create a scale set. You'll configure it to run a web server, in this case **nginx**. When you've configured the scale set correctly, you'll deploy your web application. Then you'll set up a health probe that Azure will use to verify the availability of each VM in the scale set. Finally, you'll test the scale set by sending requests from a web browser.

## Deploy a virtual machine scale set

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and open Azure Cloud Shell.

1. In Cloud Shell, start the code editor and create a file named *cloud-init.yaml*.

    ```bash
          code cloud-init.yaml
    ```

1. Add the following text to the file:

    ```bash
        #cloud-config
        package_upgrade: true
        packages:
          - nginx
        write_files:
          - owner: www-data:www-data
          - path: /var/www/html/index.html
            content: |
                Hello world from Virtual Machine Scale Set !
        runcmd:
          - service nginx restart
    ```

    This file contains configuration information to install nginx on the VMs in the scale set.

1. Press Ctrl+S to save the file. Then press Ctrl+Q to close the code editor.

1. Run the following command to create a new resource group named `scalesetrg` for your scale set:

    ```bash
        az group create \
          --location westus \
          --name scalesetrg
    ```

1. Run the following command to create the virtual machine scale set:

    ```bash
        az vmss create \
          --resource-group scalesetrg \
          --name webServerScaleSet \
          --image UbuntuLTS \
          --upgrade-policy-mode automatic \
          --custom-data cloud-init.yaml \
          --admin-username azureuser \
          --generate-ssh-keys
    ```

    By default, the new virtual machine scale set has two instances and a load balancer.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The `custom-data` flag specifies that the VM configuration should use the settings in the *cloud-init.yaml* file after the VM has been created. You can use a cloud-init file to install additional packages, configure security, and write to files when the machine is first installed. 
    >
    > For more information, see [Cloud-init support for VMs in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/using-cloud-init).

## Configure the virtual machine scale set

1. Run the following command to add a health probe to the load balancer:

    ```bash
        az network lb probe create \
          --lb-name webServerScaleSetLB \
          --resource-group scalesetrg \
          --name webServerHealth \
          --port 80 \
          --protocol Http \
          --path /
    ```

    The health probe pings the root of the website through port 80. If the website doesn't respond, the server is considered unavailable. The load balancer won't route traffic to the server.

1. Run the following command to configure the load balancer to route HTTP traffic to the instances in the scale set:

    ```bash
        az network lb rule create \
          --resource-group scalesetrg \
          --name webServerLoadBalancerRuleWeb \
          --lb-name webServerScaleSetLB \
          --probe-name webServerHealth \
          --backend-pool-name webServerScaleSetLBBEPool \
          --backend-port 80 \
          --frontend-ip-name loadBalancerFrontEnd \
          --frontend-port 80 \
          --protocol tcp
    ```

## Test the virtual machine scale set

1. In the Azure portal, on the left, select **Resource groups** > **scalesetrg**.

1. Select the **webServerScaleSet** virtual machine scale set.

1. On the **Overview** page, note the public IP address of the virtual machine scale set.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure portal, showing the Overview page for the virtual machine scale set](../media/3-vmss-properties.png)

1. Under **Settings**, select **Instances**. Verify that the scale set contains two running VMs.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure portal, showing the instances for the virtual machine scale set](../media/3-vmss-instances.png)

1. Select **Operating system**. Verify that the VMs are running Ubuntu Linux.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure portal, showing the operating system for the virtual machine scale set](../media/3-vmss-operating-system.png)

1. Select **Size**. The VMs should be running on DS1_v2 hardware.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure portal, showing the size of the VMs in the scale set](../media/3-vmss-size.png)

1. In your web browser, go to the public IP address of the scale set. Verify that the message ```Hello World from Virtual Machine Scale Set !``` appears.
