An Azure function only runs when something explicitly tells it to execute. In this module, we explored the timer, HTTP, and blob triggers.

These are three common triggers you can use to launch your functions. Azure functions include a wide selection of triggers than can be used to respond to other types of input including external web services and internal Azure services. Although each trigger type has specific requirements, the implementation and usage patterns are similar.
