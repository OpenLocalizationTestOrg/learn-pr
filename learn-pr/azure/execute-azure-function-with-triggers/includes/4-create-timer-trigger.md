In this unit, we create an Azure function app that's invoked every 20 seconds using a timer trigger.

## Create an Azure function app

Letâ€™s start by creating an Azure Function app in the portal.

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true) using the same account you activated the sandbox with.

1. In the left navigation, select **Create a resource**.

1. Select **Compute**.

1. Locate and select **Function App**. You can also optionally use the search bar to locate and create the new resource.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the Create a resource blade with the Function App highlighted.](../media/4-click-function-app.png)

1. Enter a globally unique **App name**.

1. Select a **Subscription**.

1. Select the existing **Resource group** <rgn>[sandbox resource group name]</rgn>.

1. Choose **Windows** as your **OS**.

1. Choose **Consumption Plan** for your **Hosting Plan**. When using the Consumption Plan type you're charged for each execution of your function and resources are automatically allocated based on your application workload.

1. Select a **Location** from the available list below.

    [!include[](../../../includes/azure-sandbox-regions-first-mention-note-friendly.md)]

1. For **Runtime Stack**, leave as default *.NET*, which is the language in which we implement the function examples in this exercise.

1. Create a new **Storage** account, you can change the name if you like - it will default to a variation of the App name.

1. Select **Create**. Once the function app is deployed, go to **All resources** in the portal. The function app will be listed with type **App Service** and has the name you gave it.
 
## Create a timer trigger

Now we're going to create a timer trigger inside our function.

1. Select the Add (**+**) button next to **Functions**. This action starts the function creation process.

1. On the **Azure Functions for .NET - getting started** page, select **In-portal** and then select **continue**.

1. In the list of quick start templates, select **Timer** and then select **Create** at the bottom of the screen.

## Configure the timer trigger

We have an Azure function app with logic to print a message to the log window. We're going to set the schedule of the timer to execute every 20 seconds.

1. Select **Integrate**.

1. Enter the following value into the **Schedule** box:

    ```log
    */20 * * * * *
    ```

1. Select **Save**.

## Test the timer

Now that we've configured the timer, it will invoke the function on the interval we defined.

1. Select **TimerTrigger1**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > **TimerTrigger1** is a default name. It's automatically selected when you create the trigger.

1. Open the **Logs** panel at the bottom of the screen.

1. Observe new messages arrive every 20 seconds in the log window.

1. To stop the function from running, select **Manage** and then switch **Function State** to *Disabled*.
