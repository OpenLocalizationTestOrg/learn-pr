title: Improve the performance of an API by adding a caching policy in Azure API Management
summary: |
  API Management policies are configurable modules that you can add to APIs to change 
  their behaviors. Policies can do things like cache responses, transform documents and values, 
  call webhooks for notification or audit purposes, and retry requests after transient 
  failures. This module will use policies to enable caching in order to improve API performance 
  under load.
abstract: |

  - Identify whether or not a policy exists for the desired behavior
  - Choose a policy scope
  - Configure and apply a caching policy in the Azure portal
