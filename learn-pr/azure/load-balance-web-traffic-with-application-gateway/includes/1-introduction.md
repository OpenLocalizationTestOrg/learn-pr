Imagine that you work for the motor vehicle department of a governmental organization. The department runs several public web sites that enable drivers to register their vehicles and renew their drivers license online. The vehicle registration web site has been running on a single server and has suffered multiple outages because of server failures. This has resulted in frustrated drivers who are trying to register their vehicles at the end of the month before their registrations expire. The department would like to improve resiliency by adding multiple web servers to their site and distribute the load across them. They would also like to centralize their site on a single load-balancing service to simplify the URLs for site visitors.
