You've learned about the load balancing and application routing capabilities of Application Gateway. You've deployed multiple web sites across different services, and used Application Gateway to ensure availability of those services. You've also used path-based routing to route requests based on the URL the user is requesting. Lastly, you deployed Application Gateway with the WAF enabled to take advantage of the built-in security that this feature provides.

You can now take advantage of the advanced routing and load-balancing capabilities that Application Gateway provides in your own environment.
