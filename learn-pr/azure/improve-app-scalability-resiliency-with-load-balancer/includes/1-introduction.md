Many apps need to be resilient to failures and scale easily when demand increases. You can address those needs by using Azure Load Balancer.

Suppose you work for a health care organization that's launching a new portal application where patients schedule appointments. The application has a patient portal with a web application front end and business tier database.

The database is used by the front end to retrieve and save patient information. The new portal needs to be available around the clock to handle failures. The portal must adjust to fluctuations in load, by adding and removing resources to match the load. The organization needs a solution that distributes work across the system to virtual machines as they're added. The solution should detect failures and reroute jobs to machines as appropriate. This improved resiliency and scalability will ensure that patients can schedule appointments from any location when required.

By the end of this module, you will be able to use Azure Load Balancer to build a resilient and scalable app architecture.
