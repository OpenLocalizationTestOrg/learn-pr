To use the Application Insights SDK, you need to reference a package or library and add configuration and code to your app.

In the example of the video-sharing app, stakeholders have authorized the use of the Application Insights SDK to get more information about the application.

In this unit, you'll learn about the Application Insights SDK and how to add it to an app.

## What is the Application Insights SDK?

The Application Insights SDK is a software package you reference and use in your application's code. The SDK hooks into the web application framework that powers your app and automatically captures detailed runtime information, including data about HTTP requests, system metrics, service dependencies, and exceptions. It also lets you add code to record information about events and metrics that are specific to the business domain of your app.

The SDK sends this telemetry data to an Application Insights resource in Azure. The Application Insights service processes and aggregates the data into a form that's easy to query and visualize.

Use of the SDK is not limited to web applications. You can instrument any kind of service or component for which you want to record telemetry, though most of the data that the SDK can record automatically is specific to web apps. And the SDK isn't limited to applications that are deployed to Azure.

## Why install the SDK?

The Application Insights SDK provides these benefits:

- **Comprehensive data collection**: Data like user retention, unique users, and unique sessions is available in Application Insights only when you use the Application Insights SDK.
- **Custom telemetry**: With the SDK, you can add code to your application to capture events and metrics that are specific to your app and its business domain.
- **Advanced features**: Some Application Insights features are available only when you use the SDK. For example, Live Metrics Stream lets you watch and drill down into metrics in real time.
- **Local telemetry in Visual Studio**: Telemetry data from applications instrumented with the SDK can be viewed locally in Visual Studio when you run the app in the debugger.

Azure App Service lets you enable Application Insights for an application without adding the SDK to your code. This feature, called *runtime instrumentation*, doesn't offer deep insight into your app the way the SDK can. Runtime instrumentation is also an Azure-specific feature and is available only for Windows-based web apps. The SDK can be used to instrument any application, service, or component running anywhere.

### Customized insights

When you configure and initialize the SDK in your code, it tracks the kinds of events and metrics that are common to all web applications, like request and response metrics, HTTP queue lengths, and performance counters like CPU and memory utilization. But most applications will have domain-specific events and metrics that you'll be interested in. For your video sharing app, it would help to know something about how customers use the videos. For example:

- How often do users watch the whole video?
- How often do users stop the video before the end?
- How often does buffering interrupt a video?
- On average, how many videos are being viewed at the same time during each hour of the day?

You can add code to your app that uses the SDK to record these events in Application Insights. You can then monitor these events and present summaries about them in Application Insights.

## How to use the SDK

Assuming you already have a web app and an Application Insights resource in Azure, to install the SDK in your web app project, you need to:

1. Reference the SDK in your app.
1. Configure your app with the instrumentation key of your Application Insights resource.
1. Initialize the SDK in code to begin generating telemetry.

The exact steps you'll need to take depends on the tools, programming language, and application framework you're using. In this module, we'll complete these steps for an ASP.NET Core application from the command line.

### Install the SDK package

The following `dotnet` command adds a reference to the `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AspNetCore` NuGet package to an ASP.NET Core app from the command line. This package includes the base Application Insights SDK and libraries that make it easy to use from ASP.NET Core applications.

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AspNetCore
```

### Configure the instrumentation key

Every Application Insights resource in Azure is uniquely identified by a GUID *instrumentation key*. Applications that use the SDK to send telemetry data need to be configured with the instrumentation key of the Application Insights resource to which the data should be sent.

You can find the instrumentation key for an Application Insights resource in the Azure portal, in the overview panel of the resource. You can also retrieve it via the Azure CLI by using this command:

```azurecli
az resource show \
    --resource-group <resource_group_name> \
    --name <resource_name> \
    --resource-type "Microsoft.Insights/components" \
    --query properties.InstrumentationKey
```

After you have the key, the ASP.NET Core version of the SDK supports two methods of configuring it:

- **Configuration file**: In the `appsettings.json` file for your application, create a section called `ApplicationInsights` and add a new configuration value called `InstrumentationKey`, like so:

    ```json
    {
      "ApplicationInsights": {
        "InstrumentationKey": "11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555"
      }
    }
    ```
- **Environment variable**: Create an environment variable called `APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY` that contains the value of the key. This value needs to be present in the environment when the application is started. For apps deployed to Azure App Service, you create an environment variable by configuring an application setting. If you enable runtime instrumentation in an App Service web app, Azure will automatically create the setting with the correct value.
 
The best practice is to use a different instrumentation key and Application Insights resource for each environment in which your application runs to prevent unrelated telemetry from being grouped together. For this reason, it's often simpler to use an environment variable and include this configuration as part of the setup of your app's deployment environment.

### Initialize the SDK in code

Finally, you must initialize Application Insights in your web app.

ASP.NET Core applications start up by calling `CreateWebHostBuilder()` in *Program.cs*. You can configure many aspects of the application and the runtime by chaining additional method calls here, including Application Insights. A call to `UseApplicationInsights()` will load your instrumentation key from configuration, trigger the SDK to automatically generate telemetry about many application events, and enable access to a `TelemetryClient` object from controllers and other components for custom event and metric tracking.

Here's what the relevant section of *Program.cs* will look like after you initialize Application Insights:

```C#
public static IWebHostBuilder CreateWebHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
    WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
        .UseApplicationInsights()
        .UseStartup<Startup>();
```
