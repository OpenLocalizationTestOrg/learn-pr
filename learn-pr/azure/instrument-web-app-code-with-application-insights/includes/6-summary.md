In this module, we used the Application Insights SDK to generate custom event telemetry from our video web app. We added a reference to the SDK to our project, configured the environment, initialized the SDK in code, and used `TrackEvent()` to track a custom, domain-specific event. This is a powerful tool that will allow you to track events and gain insights into your application usage.
