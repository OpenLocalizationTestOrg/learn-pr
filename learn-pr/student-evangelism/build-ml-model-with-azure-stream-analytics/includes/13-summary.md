In this module, you've explored several Azure services and connected them together.

You built a solution that feeds data from a simulated array of cameras into an [Azure IoT hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/iot-hub/), uploads photographs to [Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/?v=16.50), processes the data using [Azure Stream Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/stream-analytics/), analyzes the photographs using the [Custom Vision Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/), and visualizes the output using [Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/). You also got first-hand experience using [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions/) and [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database/).

It's a sophisticated solution that has shown you how to:

- Inject streaming data with Azure IoT Hub
- Analyze the data with Azure Stream Analytics
- Use Cognitive Services to predict results
- Use Power BI to visualize the output

You can also delete the Custom Vision Service project if you like. Just open the project and click the "trash can" icon on the Polar Bear Project tile listed on the Projects page.
