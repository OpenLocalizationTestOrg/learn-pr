summary: Analyze streaming data with a machine learning model and visualize the output.
abstract:  | 
  In this module, you will:
  - Create an Azure Storage account and an IoT hub and use a Node.js app to connect them to a simulated camera
  - Use Azure Stream Analytics to run queries on live streams to analyze input and an Azure Function to return output
  - Use Microsoft Cognitive Services to train an image classification model and call the model from an app or service
  - Connect Power BI to an Azure SQL database and visualize data from the database
prerequisites: |
  - An Azure subscription
  - Basic knowledge of Azure services, the Azure portal, and the Azure CLI tools
