<!-- TODO: Creating slideshows in Azure Notebooks is currently broken. See https://github.com/Microsoft/AzureNotebooks/issues/445 -->

What if you wanted to take a notebook you've created and use it in a presentation? You can use create slide shows from the cells in a notebook and play them back when it's presentation time. In this exercise, you will create a slide show from the notebook you built in the previous exercises.

1. Scroll up to the top of the notebook. Then select **View** -> **Cell Toolbar** -> **Slideshow**. This will display a **Slide Type** drop-down in each cell for specifying how individual cells behave during a slide show.

Creating slide shows is easy. But what if you want to share a notebook with colleagues so they can use it, too? That is the subject of the next exercise.
