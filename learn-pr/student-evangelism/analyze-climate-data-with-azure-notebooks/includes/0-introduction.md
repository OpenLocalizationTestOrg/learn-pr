Azure Notebooks is a cloud-based platform for building and running [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks. Jupyter is an environment based on [IPython](https://ipython.org/) that facilitates interactive programming and data analysis using a variety of programming languages, including Python. Jupyter notebooks enjoy widespread use in research and academia for mathematical modeling, machine learning, statistical analysis, and for teaching and learning how to code.

Azure Notebooks provide Jupyter as a service for free. It's a convenient way to build notebooks and share them with others without having to install and manage a Jupyter server. And it's web-based, making it an ideal solution for collaborating online. In this lab, you will create an Azure Notebook and use three popular Python libraries — [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html), [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) — to analyze climate data collected by NASA. Then you will share the notebook so others can experiment with it, too.

## Learning objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Create a notebook in Azure Notebooks
- Upload, manipulate, and visualize data in a notebook
- Share notebooks online
