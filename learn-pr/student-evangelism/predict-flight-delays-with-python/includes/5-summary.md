In this module, you learned how to:

> [!div checklist]
> - Create a notebook in Azure Notebooks
> - Import data into a notebook using `curl`
> - Use [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) to clean and prepare data
> - Use [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) to build a machine-learning model
> - Use [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to visualize the results

Pandas, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib are among the most popular Python libraries on the planet. With them, you can prepare data for use in machine learning, build sophisticated machine-learning models from the data, and chart the output. Jupyter notebooks provide a ready-made environment for using these libraries, and Azure Notebooks give you easy access to Jupyter notebooks without requiring you to install any software or set up a Jupyter environment on a server.
