  questions:
    - content: "What file types can be used to create a table by using the workspace UI?"
      choices:
        - content: CSV
          explanation: Multiple file types are supported, not just CSV. 
          isCorrect: false
        - content: JSON
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Multiple file types are supported, not just JSON. 
        - content: Avro
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Multiple file types are supported, not just Avro.
        - content: All of the above.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. The CSV, JSON, and Avro file types are supported.   
    - content: "Which Python statement will yield a Spark DataFrame from the query?"
      choices:
        - content: df = spark.sql("SELECT * FROM usedcars")
          explanation: Correct. After this line is executed, the variable df will refer to a Spark DataFrame. 
          isCorrect: true
        - content: df = "SELECT * FROM usedcars".todf()
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: This syntax isn't valid.
        - content: df = spark.sql("SELECT * FROM usedcars").toPandas()
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: This syntax will produce a Pandas DataFrame, not a Spark DataFrame.
    - content: "Which method is used to calculate the correlation on all features in a Pandas DataFrame?"
      choices:
        - content: correlation(df)
          explanation: This syntax is invalid.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: df.correlation()
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: This method isn't the correct one for calculating the correlation on all features in a Pandas DataFrame.
        - content: df.corr()
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. The corr() method is invoked on a Pandas DataFrame to calculate the correlation on all features in the DataFrame.
    - content: "Which method is used in Python cells to display the results as a formatted table or chart visualization?"
      choices:
        - content: df.display()
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: This syntax is invalid.
        - content: display(df)
          explanation: Correct. This syntax renders the output of the cell as a formatted table or chart.
          isCorrect: true
        - content: print(df)
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: The print() method displays the DataFrame as a text-only table, not a formatted table.
