quiz:
  questions:
    - content: "Which of the following is a feature of Azure SQL Data Warehouse that can help you save in compute costs when you don't need to run any queries for a while?"
      choices:
        - content: Scale down the data warehouse units (DWUs).
          explanation: While scaling down DWUs can save you money by reducing the per-hour cost of running your SQL Data Warehouse instance, it's meant to scale your data warehouse to adapt to the data processing needs of your environment.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: Delete your SQL Data Warehouse instance and restore it later from backup.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: This option puts your data in a state of unnecessary risk, and there's a faster option. 
        - content: Pause the SQL Data Warehouse instance.
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Pausing allows you to save compute costs, and it only takes seconds to pause and resume an instance.
    - content: "What's the recommended way to save data if you plan to run several queries against one SQL Data Warehouse table?"
      choices:
        - content: Save the data in a format like Parquet.
          explanation: This format is correct for multiple queries on the same table because each query can extract a large amount of data to Blob storage.
          isCorrect: true
        - content: Use the SQL Data Warehouse connector.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: The SQL Data Warehouse connector would be too slow for constant querying against the table because of the amount of data extracted.
        - content: Save data directly to Azure Blob storage.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Saving data directly to Azure Blog storage isn't efficient for querying.
    - content: "What are the two prerequisites for connecting Azure Databricks with SQL Data Warehouse that apply to the SQL Data Warehouse instance?"
      choices:
        - content:  Create a database master key and configure the firewall to enable Azure services to connect.
          explanation: Correct!
          isCorrect: true
        - content: Use a correctly formatted ConnectionString and create a database master key.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. You also need to configure the firewall to enable Azure services to connect.
        - content: Add the client IP address to the firewall's allowed IP addresses list and use the correctly formatted ConnectionString.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect.
