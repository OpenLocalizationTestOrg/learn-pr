Imagine that you work in the IT department of a large retail store. Your organization uses Azure Data Lake to store all its online shopping data. However, as the volume of data increases, updating and querying information from storage is becoming more and more time consuming. Your responsibility is to investigate the problem and find a solution.

You need a solution that matches Data Lake in scalability but is also reliable and fast.

Databricks Delta can solve your problem. It's a unified data-management system that combines the best capabilities of Data Lake, data warehousing, and a streaming ingestion system.
