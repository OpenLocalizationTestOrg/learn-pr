title: Create data pipelines by using Databricks Delta
summary: Learn how to use Databricks Delta in Azure to manage the flow of data (a data pipeline) to and from a data lake. This system includes mechanisms to create, append, and upsert data to Apache Spark tables, taking advantage of built-in reliability and optimizations. Learn how Databricks Delta architecture helps speed up reads, and how it lets multiple writers modify a dataset simultaneously and see consistent views. Finally, implement a Lambda Architecture by processing batch and streaming data with Delta.
