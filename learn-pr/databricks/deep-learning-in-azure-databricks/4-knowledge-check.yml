quiz:
 questions:
    - content: "Which library can you use to achieve parallelized deep learning in Azure Databricks?"
      choices:
        - content: Tensorflow
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Tensorflow on its own doesn't support parallelized deep learning in Azure Databricks.
        - content: TFLearn
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: TFLearn doesn't support parallelized deep learning in Azure Databricks.
        - content: Spark Deep Learning
          explanation: Spark Deep Learning supports parallelized deep learning in Spark and Azure Databricks. 
          isCorrect: true
    - content: "When dealing with images, which of the following deep-learning techniques might be used?"
      choices:
        - content: Convolution
          explanation: Convolution is a mathematical technique often used by artificial neurons in a network to process image data.
          isCorrect: true
        - content: Lemmatization
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Lemmatization is used in text preprocessing, not for images.
    - content: "Which of these definitions best describes the function of an autoencoder neural-network architecture?"
      choices:
        - content: A network that automatically encodes image data into a vector.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: This definition of an autoencoder is incomplete.
        - content: A network that encodes an image into a compressed feature vector and then re-creates the image from the vector.
          explanation: This definition correctly describes an autoencoder.
          isCorrect: true
        - content: A network that automatically decodes a vector into image data.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: This definition of an autoencoder is incomplete.
