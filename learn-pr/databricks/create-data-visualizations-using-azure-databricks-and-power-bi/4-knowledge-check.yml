  questions:
    - content: "To use Power BI with DataBricks tables, which kind of connection do you need to establish first?"
      choices:
        - content: JDBC
          explanation: Obtaining the JDBC connection string to your Azure Databricks cluster is the first step to connect to Power BI.
          isCorrect: true
        - content: ODBC
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. ODBC isn't the correct connection type between Power BI and Databricks tables.
        - content: REST API direct connection
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Incorrect. REST API isn't the correct connection type between Power BI and Databricks tables.
    - content: "In notebooks, which function can be used for visualizing data in any language?"
      choices:
        - content: show()
          isCorrect: false
