In this module, we explored several options for data visualization by using Azure Databricks. You learned how to use built-in Databricks functions to present your complex analytical data in easy to understand visual formats. You also explored how Databricks integrates with Power BI and Matplotlib to provide options for advanced and customized visualizations. Now you can use these visualization techniques to present your data in formats that are useful to a wide range of audiences.

## Cleanup

If you plan to complete other Azure Databricks modules, don't delete your Azure Databricks instance yet. You can use the same environment for the other modules.

### Delete the Azure Databricks instance

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true).
1. In the left pane, select **Resource groups**, and then find the resource group that contains your Azure Databricks instance.
1. Select the resource group, and either right-click the row or use the **ellipsis** (...) button to open the context menu.
1. Select **Delete resource group**.
1. Enter the name of the resource group, and then select **Delete**. Azure will remove all the resources for you.
