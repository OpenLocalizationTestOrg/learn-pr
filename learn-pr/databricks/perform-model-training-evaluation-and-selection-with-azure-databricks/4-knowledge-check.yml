  questions:
    - content: "Which of these descriptions best matches the purpose of training data?"
      choices:
        - content: A subset of the data that's used to test what the algorithm has learned.
          explanation: Testing the algorithm isn't the purpose of training data. 
          isCorrect: false
        - content: The dataset used in its entirety to teach the algorithm.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Only a subset of the complete dataset should be used for training data. 
        - content: A subset of the data that's used to teach the algorithm. 
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. This subset is the data that the algorithm will learn from.  
    - content: "What's the likely cause when a supervised model makes predictions perfectly against all the training data but fails against new data?"
      choices:
        - content: Overfitting
          explanation: Correct. Overfitting occurs when the model has effectively memorized the answers for the data that it's seen but hasn't learned to make predictions against data that it hasn't yet seen. 
          isCorrect: true
        - content: Underfitting
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Underfitting results in poor performance against both training data and data the model hasn't seen yet.
    - content: "What's used to guide the improvement of the model during model training?"
      choices:
        - content: Plotting the error
          explanation: While plotting the error can be helpful to understanding the model's performance, it isn't what's ultimately used to train the model.
          isCorrect: false
        - content: Regression
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Regression is a type of algorithm, not an approach used for model training.
        - content: Minimizing the error
          isCorrect: true
          explanation: Correct. Supervised models use different variants of error calculations during training to find the coefficients that minimize the error observed between the prediction and the value expected from the training data.
    - content: "Which of these descriptions best summarizes the difference between regression and classification?"
      choices:
        - content: Regression predicts numeric outcomes, and classification predicts labels.
          explanation: Correct. Regression outputs numeric values, and classification outputs categories.
          isCorrect: true
        - content: Regression predicts a binary outcome.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: The output of regression is the prediction of a numeric outcome.
        - content: Classification predicts a binary label.
          isCorrect: false
          explanation: Classification algorithms can predict binary labels but can also be used to predict multiple labels.
