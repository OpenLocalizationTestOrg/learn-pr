Creating a robust and reliable data model is an important part of data science. A robust data model:

- Works efficiently based on multiple metrics.
- Can be used for different kinds of datasets.
- Produces easy to interpret results.

You can train and evaluate your data model by using the machine-learning capabilities of Apache Spark. How you want to use your model depends on your end goal. For example, you can train your machine-learning model to analyze historical patterns in a dataset and predict future trends.

In this module, we'll look at various techniques for training and evaluating your data model.
