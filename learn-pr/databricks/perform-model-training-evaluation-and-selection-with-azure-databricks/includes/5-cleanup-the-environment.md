In this module, you learned how to train your machine-learning model by using Azure Databricks. To create a high-performing machine-learning model, you must train it using different parameters and evaluate its performance against several sample datasets. At the end of this process, select the machine-learning model that generates the most accurate results and use it for your real-world scenarios.
