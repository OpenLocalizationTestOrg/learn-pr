In this unit, you'll clean up any Azure resources used by the lab so that you do not incur any unexpected Azure costs.

If you plan on completing other Azure Databricks modules, don't delete your Azure Databricks instance yet. You can use the same environment for the other modules.

1. Navigate to the Resource Group that contains your Azure Databricks instance.
1. Select **Delete resource group**.
1. Type the name of the resource group in the confirmation text box.
