Text analytics, also known as text mining or text data mining is a process of analyzing unstructured text data to derive high-quality meaningful information that can be used for predictive classification purposes or to respond to different types of business problems.

The following are some of the basic outputs generated from text analytics algorithms:

- Text analytics can be used to find who, what, or where from a set of unstructured textual data. The algorithms can be designed to output keywords for a location, company name, or a product name.

- It's also used to derive a meaningful, short, and concise summary of large volumes of text data.

- Text mining algorithms scan the textual data to derive the theme or concept being conveyed in a given set of textual data.

- Text analytics is also widely used to perform sentiment analysis based on the positive, negative, or neutral keywords used in the data.
