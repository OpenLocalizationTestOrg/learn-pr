The Computer Vision API is a powerful tool for processing images. Using this service instead of building your own has the potential to save you significant development and maintenance costs. You concentrate on writing business logic to make decision relevant to your business and let the Computer Vision API extract rich information from images to categorize and process visual data.

In this module, we analyzed images, extracted text, and generated thumbnails. To call the Computer Vision API, we created a cognitive services account in our Azure subscription. This account gave us the access keys we needed to make calls.

As a next step, take some time to make the same calls with your own images. Then, tweak parameters on each call to see the effect they have on the results. You can go further and try out the other operations on the API, such as, `describe` and `tag`.
