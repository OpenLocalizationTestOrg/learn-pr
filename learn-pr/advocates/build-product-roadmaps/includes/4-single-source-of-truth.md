As we've discovered, you share your product road map with a wide diversity of potential audiences. You also need to keep track of a lot of detail on what you're building and how it's progressing. These requirements mean you should really have a single source of truth for your road map. If suddenly you have data in multiple places, then you need to update all the audience-centric plans when something changes. 

This problem is where an off-the-shelf road map tool starts to come in handy. These tools allow you to create the various road map components as artifacts. They allow you to track to what you are building, what you plan to build, and the state of your road map.

There are a wide selection of potential tools available to you. These tools range from add-ons or extensions to common ticketing frameworks like [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), GTD planning tools like [Trello](https://trello.com/) and [Asana](https://asana.com/), or product-centric road map tools like [Clubhouse](https://clubhouse.io/). These tools allow you to have a single source of truth and output the data in different forms, suitable for varying audiences.

You can do similar tracking with documents and [a spreadsheet](https://github.com/msft4startups/learn-modules/raw/master/product_module/ProductRoadmapTemplate.xlsx) but neither of these tools is designed for this purpose and lack tracking and reporting capabilities. They're not the optimal tools for managing a road map. These tools are, however, cheap or free.

If you donâ€™t already have a tool, then we recommend you try a few to find one that suits your team. Here are some useful selection factors to consider:

* Does the tool allow you to plan at all the levels of granularity: milestones, epic, story?
* Does the tool have a means of prioritizing work?
* Does the tool integrate with other products in your tool chain, for example with version control, CI/CD, and your collaboration and support tools?
* Does the tool have reporting and analytics capabilities?
* Will the tool still work for your team in 6, 12, or 18 months?

You can use these criteria to evaluate the available solutions to find one that works for your organization.
