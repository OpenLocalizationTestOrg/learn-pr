Your company has decided to invest in a better system for detecting defects in the solar roof tiles it manufactures. The manual QA pass is great for detecting obvious structural cracks in the tiles. However, 8% of tiles that are delivered to customers still have flaws. It's time to add automation to reduce this error rate and save money. Your manager is already in the process of purchasing video equipment to scan tiles. As the lead developer, your task is to come up with a solution to detect the flaws by looking at these tile images. You do your research and decide its time to try an AI approach - train a neural network to find the flaws. 

Building the right tool chain for deep learning is time-consuming and expensive. Investing in the hardware to train a model is expensive. Azure and the Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM) is a great option to control your costs and scale as needed. You get all the deep learning tools you need and the ability to deploy powerful virtual machines to crunch data and train a neural network.  

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

  - Describe deep learning and the Azure Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM)
  - Create a DSVM with the Azure CLI
  - Learn how to use Docker to set up a custom deep learning environment
  - Connect to Jupyter notebooks through Docker on the DSVM
  - Run your first deep learning experiment with Jupyter Notebooks
