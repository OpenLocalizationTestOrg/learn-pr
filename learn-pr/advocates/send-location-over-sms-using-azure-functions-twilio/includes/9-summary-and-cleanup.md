You've successfully created a cross-platform mobile app using Xamarin and Azure Functions with a Twilio binding.

In this module, you used Azure Functions and Twilio to create an app that detects a user's geographical location and sends it to a phone number via SMS. You also published your function to Azure so that it can run in the cloud. 

## Clean up

To avoid any unexpected cost, once you are done with the exercises delete any resources you created in the Azure portal for the purpose of this module.
