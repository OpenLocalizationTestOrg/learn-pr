The app has a UI and a ViewModel. In this unit, you'll add location lookup to the ViewModel using Xamarin.Essentials.

## Enable location permissions

All mobile platforms have security around user information and certain hardware, such as camera, photo library, and the user's location. Before an app can access the user's location, the user has to grant permission - either by implicitly granting these permissions at install time or by choosing to grant a permission at runtime. When you view a UWP app in the store, the listing will show the permissions that the app needs. By installing the app, you implicitly grant permission. These permissions are configured in an app manifest file.

1. In the `ImHere.UWP` app project, open the `Package.appxmanifest` file.

1. Head to the **Capabilities** tab and check the *Location* capability.

## Query for the user's location

There are two ways to get the user's location - the last known or the current. The current location can take some time to get because the device may need to establish a GPS link and wait for the accurate location to be retrieved. The fastest way is to get the last known location detected by the device. The last known location is potentially less accurate but is a much faster call. Locations come as the latitude and longitude in [decimal degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_degrees?azure-portal=true) and the altitude of the device in meters above sea level.

1. Open the `MainViewModel` class in the `ImHere` .NET Standard project.

1. Add a using directive for the `Xamarin.Essentials` namespace.

    ```cs
        using Xamarin.Essentials;
    ```

1. In the `SendLocation` method, make a call to the `GetLastKnownLocationAsync` static method on the `Geolocation` class in the `Xamarin.Essentials` namespace.

    ```csharp
    Location location = await Geolocation.GetLastKnownLocationAsync();
    ```

1. Update the `Message` property with the user's location if one is found.

    ```csharp
    if (location != null)
    {
        Message = $"Location found: {location.Latitude}, {location.Longitude}.";
    }
    ```

    The full code for this method is below.
    
    ```csharp
    async Task SendLocation()
    {
        Location location = await Geolocation.GetLastKnownLocationAsync();
    
        if (location != null)
        {
            Message = $"Location found: {location.Latitude}, {location.Longitude}.";
        }
    }
    ```

1. Run the app and click the **Send Location** button to see the location on the UI.

> [!NOTE]
> This app uses the last known location. In a production-quality app, you would want to get the current accurate location with a time-out, and if one is not found in time, fall back to the last known. You can read more on how to do this in the [Xamarin.Essentials Geolocation docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/essentials/geolocation?tabs=uwp#using-geolocation?azure-portal=true).
> 
> This app does not have error handling. In a production-quality app, you should handle any exceptions that occur, such as if the location was not available.

## Summary

In this unit, you learned how to use Xamarin.Essentials to get the user's location. In the next unit, you'll create the Azure Functions to act as a back end for the mobile app.
