The last component of a pitch is the "ask". This ask might be a call to action to use the product, to buy it, or frequently, to raise money to develop the product further. For Fabrikam, they're seeking 2 million dollars in investment that they will use to develop the prototype into a fully fledged product.

In some regards, the "ask" is the easiest part of the pitch. You only need to articulate:

* What you want.
* What you are going to do with the results of that ask.

In Fabrikam's case, they're looking for 2 million dollars in seed funding.

They're going to spend it on customer acquisition and growing their team.

## Exit strategy

One way to wrap up your ask is to explain, if you succeed with the product, what your proposed exit strategy is. This exit might be going public, growing a private company, or being acquired.

> With our successful seed funding we aim to grow our customer base to 3 million users by 2022, producing 90 million dollars in revenue and thus be an attractive target for an acquisition or merger with a large retail company.
