  questions:

  - content: 'Which of the following data sources need to be validated?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Data from a 3rd party API'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'This is just one of many sources that needs to be validated.'
    - content: 'Data from the URL parameter'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'This is just one of many sources that needs to be validated'
    - content: 'Data collected from the user via an input field'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'This is just one of many sources that needs to be validated.'
    - content: 'All of the above'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'All these sources of data need to be validated. Never trust any data that could have been modified.'

  - content: 'Parameterized queries (stored procedures in SQL) are a secure way to talk to the database because:'
    choices:
    - content: 'They are more organized than inline database commands, and therefore less confusing for users.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Organization of the code is not the reason that parameterized queries are more secure than inline SQL.'
    - content: 'There is a clear outline of the script in the stored procedure, ensuring better visibility.'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Clear outline of the script is not the reason that parameterized queries are more secure than inline SQL.'
    - content: 'Parameterized queries substitute variables before running queries, meaning it avoids the opportunity for code to be submitted in place of a variable.'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Parameter fields used in parameterized queries are treated as data, not code, protecting against injection vulnerabilities. For more information on how to implement parameterized queries please see the [OWASP Query Parameterization Cheat Sheet]( https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Query_Parameterization_Cheat_Sheet).'

  - content: 'Which of the following data needs to be output encoded?'
    choices:
    - content: 'Data saved to the database'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Although data saved to the database needs to be validated to ensure the data is good, we do not need to encode it for output.'
    - content: 'Data to be output to the screen'
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: 'Data sent to the screen needs to be output encoded to ensure it is never interpreted as code.'
    - content: 'Data sent to a 3rd party API'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Although data sent to a 3rd party API needs to be validated to ensure the data is good, we do not need to encode it for output.'
    - content: 'Data in the URL parameters'
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: 'Although data from URL Parameters needs to be validated before it is used in our application, we do not need to encode it for output.'
