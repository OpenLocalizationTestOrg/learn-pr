Organizations big and small have started to realize just how crucial system and application reliability is to their business. They’ve also learned just how difficult it is to maintain that reliability while iterating at the speed demanded by the marketplace. 

Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is a proven approach to this challenge. This module will introduce you to the principles and practices of SRE. If you’ve had any operations experience (as a sysadmin, IT pro, DevOps practitioner, etc.) or even the interest, SRE will prove to be a fascinating subject.

At the end of this module, you’ll have a good understanding of what SRE is and why it matters. You’ll be able to talk to other people about where it came from and how it relates to other operations practices like DevOps. Along the way, you’ll grasp the core principles and some of the practices that help implement these principles. We'll end with some suggestions on how you can get started with this valuable operations practice.
