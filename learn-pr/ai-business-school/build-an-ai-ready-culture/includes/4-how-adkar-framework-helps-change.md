## Introduction

As discussed previously, fostering an AI-ready culture requires a fundamental transformation in how you do things, how employees relate to each other, what skills they have, and what processes and principles guide your behaviors. **All these changes require altering behaviors, which in turn requires letting go of old habits and adopting new ones**. This is, without a doubt, one of the hardest things for people to do.

**A cultural transformation like this is driven largely by leaders** and requires an approach that generates energy and inspires employees. In the age of AI, leadership needs to be nimble and responsive in managing change.

Change management as a discipline **enables organizations to help their people adopt organizational changes**. Change management techniques are most helpful when they use a framework that guides the organization in a structured manner. There are many approaches and frameworks on the market that cater to different types of organization and cultures. To better illustrate the learnings and concepts shared in this module we will connect them to Prosci’s ADKAR change management framework.

## Basic change concepts

Before getting into Prosci's framework, we would like to highlight some ideas that are key in every change process, and that provide a useful context to understand the pillars of Prosci’s model.

* **Senders and receivers:** It’s important to keep in mind that every communication has a sender and a receiver, so what one person says may not mean what the other hears or understands. In addition, the identity of the sender can influence how the message is received. You need to keep these two things in mind when preparing and managing change.
* **Resistance:** Resistance is a constant in every change process. The question is never if an organization will find resistance, but when and how intense it will be. Always be prepared to manage resistance.
* **Value systems:** The value system and history of change in an organization matter. They determine the credibility and success of each new change initiative. Account for that when managing change.
* **Authority for change:** Having the right leadership and sponsorship is of paramount importance. Sponsorship should be active and visible, not just in name only. Executive sponsorship provides resources and funding, establishes priorities, and understands and communicates why the change is being made. It also provides consistent support and the proper channel for resistance management.
* **Incremental vs. radical change:** The size and extent of a change matter. They impact how employees perceive and react to change, including how much they will resist that change. Account for that when designing your transformation strategies.
* **The right answer is not enough:** Changes come to life through the work and behaviors of individuals. Having the right products, technical solutions, or appealing branding is not enough to create buy-in and commitment, mitigate resistance, and eliminate fear. Leadership, at all levels, once more proves crucial.
* **Change is a process:** It does not happen in one day. Keep in mind that it’s people that change, and each person has their own process and their own pace. To ensure adoption and a new organizational state, a critical mass of people have to actually change. And it is here, at the individual level, that we need to start paying attention.

## ADKAR: The people side of change

The acronym ADKAR refers to the **five stages (or milestones) that an individual moves through to achieve change**—or to put it a different way, to move from one set of habits and behaviors to a new one. These milestones are sequential because people need to fully understand, commit, and achieve one milestone before they can effectively tackle the next one. It is only when individuals reach the last milestone that transformation becomes a reality. It’s important to note that individuals may move back and forth among these stages as they learn the new implications of a change and understand "how it impacts me." These are the five stages of the model:

![ADKAR definition: A - Awareness: Understanding the need for change and its value for the organization. D - Desire: Willingness to adopt the change and to actively support it. K - Knowledge: Understanding and having the education to change. A - Ability: Being able to put knowledge into action. R - Reinforcement: Ensuring that the new abilities and behaviors stick for good.](../media/2-1-3-A-Understand-how-the-ADKAR-framework-can-help-you-lead-org-change.jpg)

## How to move from the individual to the organizational level

Once you understand the change journey at the individual level, you might ask: how can my organization help people move through ADKAR’s five stages and ultimately achieve long-term change? Prosci defines **five essential tools to support the people side of change** and help individuals in their transformation journey. These tools are referred to as the five levers of change management.

* **Communication plan:** Change requires effective communication, from defining the right messages for the right audiences, to choosing the right channels and senders to convey information and listen to people’s concerns.
* **Sponsorship roadmap:** Sponsoring change is not something that comes naturally to everyone. Even senior leaders need a roadmap to guide through their role as a change sponsor. According to Prosci’s research, this is the number one contributor to success in any change management initiative.
* **Coaching plan:** Coaching needs to takes place between employees and their direct supervisors. The coaching plan prepares managers and direct supervisors to support and coach their teams through change. This is crucial, as it is the only tool that contributes to moving through all five ADKAR stages. The coaching plan helps supervisors first understand and commit to change themselves, so they are prepared to effectively support others.
* **Training plan:** The training plan helps build the skills and capabilities required to change.
* **Resistance management plan:** Organizations need a plan to help them prepare, prevent, and ultimately manage resistance in an effective way.

Each of these change management tools contributes to reaching particular ADKAR stages, giving organizations practical guidance on how to help individuals reach the different milestones. It’s essential for organizations to use all five change management tools, as none of them alone is sufficient to support effective change.

Now that you understand the change journey, let’s take a holistic look at your organization through a model that will help you understand how prepared your organization is to take advantage of AI.
