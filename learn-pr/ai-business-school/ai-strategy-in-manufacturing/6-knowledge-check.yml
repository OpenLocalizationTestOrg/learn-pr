  questions:
  - content: "A manufacturing company with a history of large capital expenditures is considering implementing AI digital learning applications. Which criteria should be considered to determine which applications they should start with?"
    choices:
    - content: "Those that cut costs the most."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While cost cutting is important, it is not the determining factor in AI application selection."
    - content: "Those that can replicate the most complex tasks."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The goal of AI in manufacturing is to support human workers in complex tasks."
    - content: "Those that don’t rely on real-time data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. AI relies on real-time data in order to be effective."
    - content: "Those that create the most value."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Applications that drive the most value should be implemented first."
  - content: "How is AI impacting human employees in the manufacturing sector?"
    choices:
    - content: "Workers are augmented with greater knowledge and actionable insights to grow and develop."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. AI is removing mundane tasks from employees and augmenting them with greater knowledge and actionable insights from data."
    - content: "Workers are learning technology skills that allow them to pursue more meaningful work in other industries."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Manufacturing employees are able to remain in the industry and pursue more meaningful work opportunities within manufacturing."
    - content: "Workers are more productive after emulating the efficient work processes perfected by machine learning"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The purpose of machine learning is to transfer some human work processes to machines permanently, moving human workers to more meaningful and decision-oriented tasks."
    - content: "Supervisory roles are no longer necessary as AI sensors and analytics oversee the work processes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Humans are retaining supervisory roles and depend on AI for real time data to support decision making."
  - content: "A car manufacturer wants to better utilize their AI solution by integrating “transfer learning” practices. What does this entail?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use IoT to enhance automated optical inspection processes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although AI is heavily used to detect anomalies on production lines, it is not an example of transfer learning."
    - content: "Retraining existing models to address similar problems already solved."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Transfer learning is a process in which an existing model, built using a large amount of historical data, can be retrained using only a small amount of new data and repurposed to a new, but similar, problem."
    - content: "Transition aspects of manual employee work to automation."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Although this is an aspect of AI, it is not transfer learning."
    - content: "Analyze customer behavior to learn and better understand demand cycles."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is not an example of transfer learning."
