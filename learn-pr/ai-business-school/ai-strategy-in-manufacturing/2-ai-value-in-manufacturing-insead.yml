  title: Identify the business value of AI in manufacturing with INSEAD
  description: Industries focused on manufacturing and other large-scale materials processes are at a pivotal point for the deployment of AI. In this lecture Peter Zemsky, INSEAD's Eli Lilly Chaired Professor of Strategy and Innovation, explains that while the sector has seen much experimentation with proof of concepts, the move to fully scaled AI solutions has been slower than in other sectors. He illustrates how organizations can surpass those barriers and strategically use AI to extract business value.
