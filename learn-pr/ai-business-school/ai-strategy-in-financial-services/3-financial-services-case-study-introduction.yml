  title: Transform business processes in financial services with AI - Case study introduction
  description: This case study details how security platform BioCatch leveraged AI strategically to create an “invisible” security solution that can identify users based on a unique biometric signature. As users aren’t aware of the software, it’s far less intrusive than other authentication methods and it has a very low false positive rate, leading to happier users, fewer successful cybercrimes, and cost savings for financial services businesses.
