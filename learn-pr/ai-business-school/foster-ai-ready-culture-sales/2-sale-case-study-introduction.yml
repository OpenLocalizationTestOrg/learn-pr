  title: Discover how to foster an AI-ready culture in sales - Case study introduction
  description: The Microsoft sales team wanted to help sellers generate new business pipeline, pitch the right services at the right time, and streamline their call preparation so they could spend more time bringing value to our customers. We created an AI-based guided selling application that provides sellers with data-driven insights and actionable product recommendations to help them increase conversion rates and productivity. Since implementing AI, we’ve seen a 4x improvement in recommendation success over our previous rule–based targeting recommendations. Learn about how we incorporated AI into our sales processes and consider how AI could transform your own sales organization.
