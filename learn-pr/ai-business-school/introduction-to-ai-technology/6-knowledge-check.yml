  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which technology trend is generating large volumes of raw, unstructured information from our homes and businesses?"
    choices:
    - content: "Massive computing power"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The computing power available in cloud or on-premises processes the large volumes of information. It does not generate it."
    - content: "Powerful algorithms"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Deep learning and reinforcement algorithms powered by massive computing power and applied against Big Data enable AI. But the algorithms don’t generate the Big Data."
    - content: "Big data"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Big data is a concept related to the massive volume of unstructured data generated by our use of internal or cloud computing services such as Twitter, Netflix, GPS smartphones, and local store purchases."
    - content: "Speech recognition"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Speech recognition is one of the products and capabilities of AI: cognition, learning, and perception."
  - content: "A professional baseball team wants to apply state-of-the-art AI technology to batting practice. They believe that through advanced AI capabilities like deep learning algorithms they can learn from thousands of at-bats to gain an understanding of the art of hitting a baseball.   
Information about the pitcher’s pitch plus the batter’s stance and swing recorded by on-field cameras provide the input data. The goal is to successfully predict the results based the data. It will also enable them to teach pitchers and batters the best techniques based on the data.  
Which of the three major capabilities of AI is able to make these predictions based on thousands of recorded at-bats?"
    choices:
    - content: "Cognition"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Cognition is the ability to make predictions based on learned inputs."
    - content: "Learning"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Learning is the AI capability that observes thousands of at-bats as input and learns what results come from the different inputs. It provides the basis of perception and cognition. It doesn’t make the predictions."
    - content: "Perception"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is the ability to understand what the inputs mean. The pitcher’s stance, type of pitch, batter stance, swings trajectory, etc. This also provides the basis to predicting the outcome of the at-bat (cognition). It doesn’t make the prediction."
    - content: "Interpretation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Interpretation in the form of real-time translation or speech/hand-writing recognition comes as a result of the three major capabilities. It is not one of the three major capabilities of AI."
  - content: "A company that provides continuing professional education for nurses is attempting to integrate AI into their existing products to ensure that the education is tailored for the learners’ needs. They have invested millions of dollars into the online software that delivers these training modules.   
They do not want to throw it all away and start from scratch to include AI technology.  
Which Microsoft product would allow them to incorporate pre-built AI capabilities into their products?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure Cognitive Services"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. These are the pre-built AI services that can be purchased as a product from Azure."
    - content: "Conversational AI platforms"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Conversational AI platforms and their conversational agents are used when building a new application that are designed around AI."
    - content: "Speech to text"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Speech to text is an example of a conversational agent that might be a part of the AI used in the training software. It is not a Microsoft product that, by itself, provides AI capabilities to an existing system."
    - content: "Machine learning"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A machine learning is only a small part of an AI solution."
  - content: "Last year a large national freight company incorporated pre-built AI services into some customer-facing products and some business processes for employees. Now the COO needs to enable all employees to utilize AI in their daily tasks.  
How can the COO’s need be met?"
    choices:
    - content: "Democratize data and knowledge."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This makes data available to employees but it doesn’t fully enable AI in their daily tasks. Something in addition is required, like creating new AI models and/or pre-built AI services."
    - content: "Develop conversational agents."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Conversational agents may be a part of the AI offering, but those would be an outcome of new AI model creation."
    - content: "Create new AI models."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This would allow them to create custom AI capabilities to help them do their jobs. Sharing those new models with other employees helps them increase productivity."
    - content: "Utilize pre-built AI services."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Pre-built AI services aren’t intended to be used on a personalized basis by employees to perform their daily tasks. They are meant to integrate with existing customer-facing systems or products."
