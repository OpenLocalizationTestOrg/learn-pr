  title: Discover how to foster an AI-ready culture in marketing - Case study introduction
  description: Like most marketing organizations, Microsoft's marketing team was looking to improve conversion rates and reduce the time sellers spend pursuing unproductive marketing-qualified leads. Leveraging the power of AI to glean more insights from our data, we created an intelligent lead scoring platform that weighs thousands of variables to filter and prioritize leads before they reach sellers. Since implementing the platform, we have more than doubled our conversion rate year-over-year and significantly improved alignment between marketing and sales. This course will show you how we incorporated AI into our marketing processes and offer you insights into how AI could transform your own marketing organization.
