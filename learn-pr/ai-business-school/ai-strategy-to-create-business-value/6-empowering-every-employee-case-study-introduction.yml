  title: Discover the value of empowering every employee with AI - Case study introduction
  description: Publicis had problems that required radical solutions. Founded in 1926, the venerable agency – one of the world’s largest – found that “chaotic knowledge” ecosystems, born from keeping tech, information, and personnel structured in silos, was making it hard to execute projects quickly, provide value to customers, and keep ahead of competitors. Their new Chief Executive Officer, Arthur Sadoon, proposed a remarkable strategic fix - using AI to “break the silos,” and connect every Publicis employee to teams and tech where they could provide the most value. To do this, they created a platform called Marcel, which uses AI to structure Publicis’ vast treasure-trove of institutional knowledge and make it available to every employee.
