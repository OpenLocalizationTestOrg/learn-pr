## Summary

Through this module we have walked through some of the steps Microsoft is taking to prioritize responsible AI in the hope that our experience can help other enterprises. However, we recognize that we do not have all the answers and every individual, company, and region will have their own beliefs and standards that should be reflected in their path towards responsible AI. We should also recognize that as organizations and as a society, our steps towards responsible AI will need to continually evolve to reflect new innovations and lessons from both our mistakes and accomplishments. The processes, tools, and resources mentioned can be a starting point from which organizations can create their own AI strategy.

As the use of AI increases across the private and public sectors, it is essential that we continue to foster open dialogue among businesses, governments, NGOs, academic researchers, and all other interested individuals and organizations. Enterprises that embrace AI early have an important role to play in promoting the responsible use of AI and preparing society for its impacts. Their firsthand experience in dealing with the ethical challenges of AI will be crucial knowledge for later adopters and those trying to study or regulate AI technology.

Now that you have reviewed this module, you should be able to:

* Describe the importance of engaging with AI in a responsible manner.
* Identify six guiding principles to develop and use AI responsibly.
* Determine the elements of an AI governance system.

## Actions your organization can take

To help you consider how to leverage governance and external engagements in your own organization, we developed the recommendations below.

### Establishing an AI governance system

* **Choose a governance structure** that best fits your organization’s AI maturity, unique characteristics, culture, and business objectives
* **Encourage your governance system to develop a set of guiding ethical principles** based on your organization’s foundational values.
* **Outline the specific role of your governance system** within your organization. Consider having them develop and implement policies, standards, and best practices, build a culture of integrity, provide advice, educate employees, help mitigate risks associated with AI systems, and respond to violations in a timely and consistent manner.
* **Provide your governance system with the financial and human resources they need** to affect real change within your organization.
* **Adapt your governance system(s)** as your AI maturity and business objectives change and industry best practices improve.

### Governing AI engagement

* **Create a handbook or manual to govern the use of AI in your organization** to help ensure your employees follow the policies your governance system establishes.
* **Train employees** on the policies, standards, and best practices that your governance system establishes.

### Third party AI systems

* Research the third party’s stance on responsible design before purchasing out-of-the-box AI solutions to ensure they were designed in a manner consistent with your principles, policies, and standards.
* Include your principles in your request for proposal, so the solution can be design with your principles in mind.
* Create guidelines on how to safely operate and monitor the system and train your employees on these guidelines before deploying the system.
* Rigorously test the system to ensure it operates as intended and in a manner consistent with your principles, policies, and standards.

### First party AI systems

* **Consider having your governance system review or provide advice before the release of any new AI system**, especially for sensitive use cases.
* **Create processes for employees to analyze an AI system’s** purpose, technical capabilities, reliability, and use case prior to its release.
* **Provide clear guidelines to ensure your ethical principles are reflected in an AI system** if you are developing AI systems in-house. Support your developers by using industry-established guidelines or developing your own, especially for AI systems that raise complex ethical or human rights considerations.
* **Consider integrating internal guidelines into project management processes**, such as a checklist aligned to the phases of a data science project.
* **Leverage tools and resources** to make it easier for developers to spot and design against potentially harmful issues like biases, safety and privacy gaps, and exclusionary practices.

### Participating in external engagements

* **Engage in public and private partnerships to advance responsible use of AI.** Collaboration between enterprises, public organizations, government, and non-profits is crucial as we address the concern and challenges of AI, while maximizing its potential to deliver broad benefits.
* **Join coalitions with organizations to foster a technologically savvy workforce** and help ensure workers are prepared for the changing economy.
* **Share your AI perspective with the greater community, such as governments, businesses, and standards organizations**, to help guide responsible policies and legislation.
* **Apply your AI expertise and technologies to benefit your community** and improve the lives of people around the world.

### Security and Privacy

* **[Securing the Future of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2019/02/07/securing-the-future-of-ai-and-machine-learning-at-microsoft/)** provides guidance on how to protect algorithms, data, and services from new AI-specific security threats. While security is a constantly changing field, this paper outlines emerging engineering challenges and shares initial thoughts on potential remediation.
* **Homomorphic encryption** is a special type of encryption technique that allows users to compute on encrypted data without decrypting it. The results of the computations are encrypted and can be revealed only by the owner of the decryption key. To further the use of this important encryption technique, we developed the [Simple Encrypted Arithmetic Library](https://www.microsoft.com/research/project/simple-encrypted-arithmetic-library/) (SEAL) and made it open source.
* **Multi-party computation (MPC)** allows a set of parties to share encrypted data and algorithms with each other while preserving input privacy and ensuring that no party sees information about other members. For example, with MPC we can build a system that analyzes data from all three hospitals without any of them gaining access to each other’s health data.

### Transparency and fairness

* [Datasheets for datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010) is a paper that proposes information that dataset creators should include in a datasheet for their dataset, such as training datasets, model inputs and outputs, and model features. Like a datasheet for electronic components, a datasheet for datasets would help developers understand if a specific dataset is appropriate for their use case.
* [Local Interpretable Model-agnostics Explanations (LIME)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.04938.pdf) provides an easily understood description of a machine learning classifier by perturbing the input and seeing how the predictions change.
* [Methodology for reducing bias in word embedding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.06520.pdf) helps reduce gender biases by modifying embeddings to remove gender stereotypes, such as the association between receptionist and female, while maintaining potentially useful associations such as the association between the words queen and female.
* [A reductions approach to fair classification](https://www.microsoft.com/research/publication/a-reductions-approach-to-fair-classification/) provides a method for turning any common classifier into a “fair” classifier according to any of a wide range of fairness definitions. For example, consider a machine learning system tasked with choosing applicants to interview for a job. This method can turn a classifier that predicts who should be interviewed based on previous hiring decisions into a classifier that predicts who should be interviewed while also respecting demographic parity (or another fairness definition).
* [Generalized Additive Models plus interactions (GA2M)](https://www.microsoft.com/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kdd13.pdf) is a learning method based on generalized additive models that improves the transparency and intelligibility of a model without sacrificing its accuracy. By leveraging GA2M models, users can better understand what the models have learned and more easily remove bias and other errors that may have been introduced in the learning process.
