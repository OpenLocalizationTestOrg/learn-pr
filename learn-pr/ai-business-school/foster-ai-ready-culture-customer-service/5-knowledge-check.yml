    choices:
    - content: "Reduce the need to contract foreign support agents."

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Quote: “…transform customer service from a cost center to a key differentiator, using AI to drive scale, efficiency, and insights.”  The goal was to make customer service a “key differentiator”, not a profit center."
    - content: "Improve customer satisfaction and retention."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Quote: “Our goal was to improve customer satisfaction and retention and transform customer service from a cost center to a key differentiator, using AI to drive scale, efficiency, and insights.”"
    - content: "Prove that AI technology can replace human customer service agents."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Replacing service agents was never a goal. The goal was to enhance the quality of customer service, not reduce the workforce."
  - content: "When the Microsoft customer service team implemented AI in their business processes and work, what did the team do to empower employees with AI technology?"
    choices:
    - content: "Created a guided support tool called, “The Daily Reminder.”"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is the tool created by the Microsoft sales organization, not customer support."
    - content: "Provided a virtual agent to help the human agents prepare for support calls."
      isCorrect: true

    - content: "Provided incentives to agents who actively use AI tools."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Agents used AI to help them do a better job, not to earn incentive awards."
    - content: "Implemented machine-learning to respond to customer queries."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Machine learning doesn’t do the responding, it builds the knowledgebase that feeds data to chatbots who respond to queries."
  - content: "When the Microsoft customer service team implemented AI technology into their operations, they used machine-learning tools to analyze which types of data?"
    choices:
    - content: "Frequently asked questions."

      explanation: "Incorrect. This data may prove useful and help train machine-learning tools to help forecast types of support needed, but it was not one of the drivers of this project."
    - content: "Diagnostic log data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This data would have to come from the customer. A large amount of this type of data is not available to customer support."
    - content: "Customer feedback."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Quote: “Our customer service team partnered with data scientists to use machine learning to create a sentiment analysis tool that automates this work. It analyzes sentiment not only in customer feedback, but also in customer chat conversations.”"
