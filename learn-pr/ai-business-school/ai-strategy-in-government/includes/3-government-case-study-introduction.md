## Abstract

As government agencies around the world are trying to cut costs while tackling increasingly complex problems, the Finnish city of Espoo turned to AI to help them effectively and efficiently improve residents’ quality of life. By aggregating and analyzing immense amounts of existing service agency data, they built an AI platform that could identify factors that contribute to an individual’s or group’s use of specific government services. Analytics from the AI platform allow Espoo to more effectively focus its resources on proactively addressing root causes that lead to the need for various city services.

## Industry context

Governments are trying to tackle increasingly complex problems with fewer and fewer resources. Costs continue to rise as governments serve growing populations and offer a wider variety of public services through seamless, user-friendly experiences. According to Deloitte’s survey of more than 1,200 government officials from over 70 countries, 82% see digital technologies as an opportunity for their organization and 70% think they lag behind the private sector. At the same time, governments are under pressure to keep their costs low, to reduce budget deficits, and to avoid raising taxes. In the same global survey, 37% of government officials said insufficient funding was their top barrier to digital transformation.<sup>1</sup>

Intelligent technology is enabling governments to overcome these hurdles and meet the expectations of their citizens. AI can lower costs while helping fuel economic growth, increase access to education, improve healthcare, and keep people safe and secure. Governments are already leveraging AI for a variety of use cases, like urban mobility, tax collection, public safety, and much more. One of the most promising areas for the application of AI is making government services more efficient and accessible.

However, since AI systems in the public sector are often analyzing sensitive and personal data, governments are considering how to most effectively leverage AI while remaining transparent, complying with data regulations like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and respecting their citizens’ privacy and security. Given that regulations for AI are still in the early stages of development, governments need intelligent solutions that have the agility necessary to quickly comply with emerging data and AI regulations.

## Challenge

Espoo, the second largest city in Finland, is a major hub of technological innovation, research and development, and higher education. Like many other cities in Europe, Espoo’s city administration is tasked with providing a wide range of different utility, education, social, cultural, infrastructure, and healthcare services to almost 300,000 residents. With such a major undertaking by the public sector, it is imperative to manage services effectively.

To help deliver these services most effectively, the city administration wanted to gain a more holistic view of the people they serve and understand how to proactively support populations for the long term.

Their social, healthcare, and childhood education service agencies had already collected a huge amount of relevant data, over 500 million data points from over 37 million service interactions.  However, their data estate resided in disparate silos, making traditional methods of data analysis difficult and inefficient. The city needed a solution that could aggregate its large amounts of data, understand the correlation between different government services, and monitor how individuals have progressed across different service agencies.

“We have had some difficulty keeping service paths focused on actual citizens and their needs,” says Tomas Lehtinen, Data Analytics Consultant at the City of Espoo. “We wanted to use next-generation analytics and AI to better understand the service needs of our citizens and deliver timely, unified services.”

To help them tackle this challenge, they turned to Tieto, a leading Nordic software and services company headquartered in Espoo.

## Strategy questions

1. How can Espoo use their population data effectively to improve the services they provide to residents? Which insights should they be trying to gather?
2. What steps can Espoo take to ensure they are handling their residents’ personal data responsibly and securely?
3. What are some obstacles that can make cross-service agency coordination difficult?
4. Without having a full data science team, how can Espoo use strategic partnerships to develop effective AI solutions?
5. How can government services proactively support residents instead of reactively supporting them? What are the benefits from this proactive support?
6. Given the current status of Espoo’s data estate, what steps could be taken to gain more benefits from AI?
