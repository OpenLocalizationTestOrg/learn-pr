## Approach

As the winner of the international 2018 Intelligent Community Award, the City of Espoo is already a technology leader in the European government sector. However, they are now striving to become an AI leader as well. Espoo is looking to apply intelligent technology strategically to dramatically transform the way Espoo provides for its citizens in areas such as sustainable development, traffic flow, air quality, and even social inclusion. To further these goals, Espoo has recently joined as a member of the Finnish Center for Artificial Intelligence, which brings together the top AI researchers from around Finland.

Espoo wanted to take an AI-focused approach to improve service delivery. Working with Tieto, a leading Nordic software and services company headquartered in Espoo, the City of Espoo built an AI platform to better predict when Espoo residents would benefit from specific services. This unique experiment represented the first time government data from a range of different services has been combined and analyzed using AI in such a holistic manner. By analyzing over 14 years of data, the platform is helping the city administration tackle a key challenge: how can Espoo provide the right services to the right people, at the right time.

Hosted on Microsoft Azure, the solution leverages Azure Data Lake, which allows both structured and unstructured data from different sources to be easily aggregated, structured and analyzed at scale. Espoo performed advanced analytics on social, healthcare, and education data to identify common factors that may contribute to a service need. Then, they trained machine learning models to predict an individual’s or group’s most likely service needs based on those factors. While one factor alone may not indicate a need for a certain service, AI is able to determine that several factors together can indicate a need. By understanding the contributing factors for each service path, the City of Espoo can use their resources to tackle root causes that lead to the need for these services.

Since the models needed to train on sensitive information, the City of Espoo took careful steps to ensure the data was handled properly and securely. They applied a number of layers of technical and operational information security measures during the collection, anonymization, storage, and use of the data and then destroyed the data after the models were trained.

## Results

The platform achieved the city’s desired result: they were able to analyze a massive amount of data and identify new, more proactive means of delivering services to citizens who need them at a lower cost. It also demonstrated the potential for AI to dramatically transform the way Espoo provides for its citizens.

The solution enabled, for the first time, the city to review service paths by family instead of just on an individual basis. By also assessing services by family, Espoo has further insights on the root causes for various problems, and what services might cost-effectively improve the lives of its citizens. For example, using data from 300,000 households, they were able to identify 280 factors that could help predict which families will need child-welfare resources. By identifying at-risk families, agencies can collaborate and work proactively to extend support and resolve issues before more significant problems arise. This early support would not only increase the well-being of their residents, but also avoid heavier, more expensive service engagements.

However, the city administration launched this platform in 2017, a year before the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect. Espoo is currently working with researchers and the European Union to understand how they can continue to gain the benefits of the platform while complying with GDPR rules. They are also evaluating how to comply with recent Finnish legislation on the secondary use of social and healthcare personal data.

Eventually, the city hopes to extend the platform to support its other public services and develop new individualized, citizen-focused services. Before going down that path, the City of Espoo is committed to carefully examining the complex ethical considerations of personalizing services and care. For example, when a patient arrives at a healthcare appointment, should the care team be informed about the services the patient will most likely need? Local authorities like Espoo will need to continually balance the rights of individuals with the broader benefits that AI can bring.

## Key lessons

### Leverage data from a variety of sources

AI is only as powerful as the data it’s built on. The City of Espoo was able to gain a holistic and accurate view of how their citizens used their services because they combined and analyzed data from across their service agencies. Establishing good data practices that make it easy to combine data across your data silos and agencies can save your government time, resources, and money.

### Engage domain experts

Because the platform involves many service departments, it was important to visualize these findings in ways that make them accessible and understandable across agencies. Espoo collaborated with specialists from a variety of service sectors, all the way from the inception of the program through the final stages. They also organized a workshop with specialists in the social and healthcare services to determine the best way to communicate and display the analysis results in a way that everyone could understand.

### Consider broader AI trends when developing your AI strategy

It’s important for government organizations to consider broader AI trends and provide their perspective on AI policies and regulations. AI regulations are in relatively early stages and are likely to evolve. Since the completion of this project, the City of Espoo has been working to promote the responsible use of AI and hopes to become a Finnish and global forerunner for ethical AI in the government sector. They are collaborating with the European Union to develop rules that protect personal privacy for AI applications. They are also working with a number of international organizations to develop international standards for the ethical use of AI in government. For example, Espoo is one of the founding members of the IEEE’s Ethics Certification Program for Autonomous and Intelligent Systems (ECPAIS) which was launched to establish internationally recognized processes and certificates for the responsible use of AI.

### Evaluation of the strategy using the value framework

Let’s examine how the City of Espoo’s AI strategy is creating additional value using the value creation framework developed by Peter Zemsky, INSEAD’s Eli Lilly Chaired Professor of Strategy and Innovation:

1. From the **environment perspective**, we have discussed how governments want to provide more effective and personalized services to their citizens without increasing costs. Like many cities across the world, the city of Espoo also wants to be perceived as a global technological leader in the public sector.
2. From the **value creation perspective**, Espoo’s AI capabilities will enable them to increase the health and safety of their residents by more effectively addressing their needs. These preventative actions are generally more cost-effective as well, allowing Espoo to focus their resources on other areas.
3. From the **organization and execution perspective**, Espoo was able to develop this platform through their strong organizational focus on digital transformation, their massive accumulation of relevant data, and their strategic partnership with Tieto. To become an AI leader in the government sector, they are also partnering with other technology companies, the Finnish Center for Artificial Intelligent, the European Union, and IEEE, among others.

Now that you’ve seen how government organizations are approaching their AI strategy, let’s wrap up everything you’ve learned with a knowledge check.
