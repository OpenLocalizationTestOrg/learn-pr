Value creation is the key objective of not just businesses, but of governments as well. Through services like education, transportation, and policing, governments create value by ensuring support for citizens and fueling economic growth for the private sector. The question is—how can AI enable governments to support greater value creation for their citizens?

Watch these videos from Peter Zemsky, INSEAD’s Eli Lilly Chaired Professor of Strategy and Innovation, which illustrate how AI helps improve internal processes, service levels, and economic growth.

To select an AI use case that maximizes value, government agencies need to consider where they have key opportunities for AI, the resources they have to execute an AI initiative, and how the solution will be integrated into their existing processes.

To further explore how AI enables government organizations to streamline efficiency by improving analytics, lowering costs, and enhancing services, let’s take a closer look at taxation. A critically important government function with access to huge quantities of financial data, taxation is a prime public sector candidate for enhancement from AI.

Building upon digitization, strategic uses of AI can help government agencies better address tax enforcement, meet rising expectations for service levels, and relieve pressure from tight government budgets. Tax initiatives like these help governments minimize negative impacts on economic activity and maximize value creation for their communities.

Next, let’s see how the city of Espoo in Finland employed AI to analyze their population data and improve service delivery.
