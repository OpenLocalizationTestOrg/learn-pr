  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "How can governments strengthen their AI outcomes?"
    choices:
    - content: "Replace employees with conversational agents."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Employees are critical to the success of government initiatives, and AI empowers them to do more."
    - content: "Leave it to AI experts to plan for and execute an AI solution."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. It is important for AI experts to collaborate with domain experts to create an effective solution that aligns with organizational goals and processes."
    - content: "Establish data practices that make it easier to collect and aggregate data from a variety of sources."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. AI solutions are only as strong as the data they are based on. It is crucial for organizations to prioritize data when creating an AI strategy."
    - content: "Focus on internal uses of AI above citizen-facing uses."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. There are many valuable citizen-facing uses of AI that governments can consider, and they should focus on what will create the most value."
  - content: "Which of the following will most likely help an AI solution perform more effectively?"
    choices:
    - content: "Spending more money on the development of the AI solution."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While allocating sufficient financial resources is crucial, spending more money alone will not help your solution become more effective."
    - content: "Leveraging domain experts."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. By including relevant subject matter experts (such as those with consumer credit expertise for a credit scoring AI system) in the design process and in deployment decisions, governments can make sure the AI solution is most effectively designed to meet its purpose."
    - content: "Developing the solution in-house."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. It can be just as effective and potentially more cost effective to work with technological partners when developing the AI solution."
    - content: "Using more complex algorithms."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Using more complex algorithms will not necessarily lead to better results. Sometimes a simple algorithm combined with the right data can be more effective than a more complex algorithm."
  - content: "A local government is considering implementing an AI solution. Which criteria should it consider when choosing the best use case to start with?"
    choices:
    - content: "Value creation."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Government agencies should prioritize the overall value of the solution, which includes factors like cost, benefits, and organizational readiness for AI."
    - content: "Cost reduction."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While cost reduction is important, the ultimate consideration should be choosing solutions that create the most value for your organization."
    - content: "Work reduction for employees."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While AI can help employees with certain tasks, the ultimate consideration should be choosing solutions that create the most value for your organization."
    - content: "Difficulty of data cleansing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While data is an important consideration, the ultimate consideration should be choosing solutions that create the most value for your organization."
