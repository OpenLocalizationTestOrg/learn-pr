With AI, the way finance operates and builds a business partnership is less about reporting the past, and far more about influencing the future. For finance departments, this is a significant paradigm shift.

That said, to get to such a place within a finance department requires significant change beyond the adoption of new technologies. When exploring digital transformation with AI, the list of questions to consider about how the transformation needs to involve team members is longer than the list of questions about the various technologies. How are you going to make it important and possible for each team member to get comfortable with new technology? How are you going to incentivize them to learn and not be afraid of moving forward with this process? And how are you going to motivate them?

“What we needed was a bravery and a willingness to learn, and understand that they already knew what we needed from them. We needed to understand the business outcome, we needed their expertise to understand the variables it impacted, and we needed them to work with experts to help take their knowledge, and build tools that would make their job easier, and make the outcomes better,” Hood says, of the Microsoft finance team. AI implementation done right, she says, is about technology and people working hand in hand.

Next, learn how the Microsoft finance organization leveraged the expertise of its employees to identify opportunities to implement AI across the organization. From improving the accuracy of revenue forecasts, to reducing the strain on employees through automation, to better risk prediction, AI is saving Microsoft’s finance team hundreds of hours per month, while enabling better business decision-making and risk mitigation.
