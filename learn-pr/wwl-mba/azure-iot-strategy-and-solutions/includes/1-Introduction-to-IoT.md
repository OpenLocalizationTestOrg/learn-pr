### What is IoT?

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of Internet connected devices that communicate embedded sensor data to the cloud for centralized processing. These sensors can be embedded in everyday items such as cell phones, washing machines, vehicles or wearable devices; or they could be components of larger machines and systems such as airplanes, engines, or oil rigs.

### Why is IoT useful?

IoT enables businesses to evolve their operations, products, and customer experiences through connected devices to create new revenue streams and minimize costs. Once data is collected, it becomes possible to analyze it to gain meaningful, actionable insights. From manufacturing, to transportation, to retail, Azure can start fueling new business opportunities with IoT solutions designed for industry needs.

In this module, you will:

- Learn about the Microsoft vision for Azure IoT.
- Understand what Azure IoT is, how it works, and how it’s built.
- Identify ways you can use Azure IoT.
- Learn how Azure IoT enables digital transformation to address business challenges.

### IoT solutions

With IoT solutions, everyday things can be IoT-enabled: office buildings, home appliances, vehicles, elevators, or vending machines. These technological enhancements enable organizations to increase operational efficiency, deliver better customer experiences, and develop the opportunity to monetize the data.

IoT can be easily understood as a set of technologies connected across three main areas:

- **Things:** Physical “things,” including industry equipment, devices, or sensors, that are connected to the Internet. 
- **Insights:** Data from connected devices, and the process to normalize, transform, and analyze that information to produce insights. 
- **Action:** The systems and tools that enable people and machines to take actions based on data, in an automated or predictive manner.

This data is used to proactively prioritize the engine maintenance schedule (an action).  Now think about the things that you use every day. Pick one and list out some insights that this item could collect. What actions would these insights enable? How might these actions simplify your work?*

Now that you know more about IoT in everyday devices, let’s apply it to Microsoft Azure IoT.
