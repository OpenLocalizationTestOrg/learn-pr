Now that you’ve learned about how Azure IoT has been applied to various industries, let’s learn more about when and how you can utilize these services. 

### Azure IoT Services 

|Business Need | Azure Services | Description | Benefits |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Experience fully managed software as a service for IoT—no cloud expertise required. | Azure IoT Central |Azure IoT Central is a fully managed global IoT SaaS solution that makes it easy to connect, monitor, and manage your IoT assets at scale. | Azure IoT Central helps you derive new insights from connected devices to enable better products and experiences for your customers. In addition, it can create new business opportunities for your organization. 
|Connect, monitor, and control billions of IoT assets. | Azure IoT Hub | A managed service hosted in the cloud, Azure IoT Hub acts as a central message hub for bi-directional communication between your IoT application and the devices it manages. It provides reliable and secure communications between millions of IoT devices and a cloud-hosted solution backend. | Azure IoT Hub monitoring helps you maintain the health of your solution by tracking events such as device creation, device failures, and device connections. |
|Extend intelligence from the cloud to your edge devices. | Azure IoT Edge | Azure IoT Edge is a service that builds on top of Azure IoT Hub. This service is meant for customers who want to analyze data on devices instead of in the cloud. Azure IoT Edge devices can be deployed and executed locally. | A cloud-based interface that enables you to remotely monitor and manage Azure IoT Edge devices without having to continuously push data to the cloud. |
|Create a digital model of your physical space or assets. | Azure Digital Twins|Azure Digital Twins is an IoT service that creates comprehensive models of the physical environment. The solution can query data from a physical space rather than from many disparate sensors. |This service helps you build spatially aware experiences that link streaming data across the digital and physical world. This can be used to build solutions to manage building operations more efficiently. In addition, it can increase and optimize the efficiency of the building and design process by modeling physical environments. |
|Build and connect highly secure microcontroller (MCU)-powered devices. | Azure Sphere | An Azure Sphere is a microcontroller unit (MCU) that can be embedded in a connected device, either alongside, or in place of, existing MCU(s), to enhance security, productivity, and opportunity for product manufacturers. |With Azure Sphere, product manufacturers can create secure, connected devices that can be updated, controlled, monitored, and maintained remotely. This can be used to create a secured application environment to minimize security risks due to spoofing, rogue software, or denial of service attacks, among others. |
