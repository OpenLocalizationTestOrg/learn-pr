### Azure IoT solutions applied across industries

Azure IoT solutions tend to be horizontal and span multiple industries. Industry experts may use different terminology to describe IoT applications, but they are generally referring to the five common scenarios listed below. Later in the module, we will also review how these solutions can be applied with Azure IoT services.

|Scenario|Description|Industry Example|
|----------|-----------|----------|
|**Remote monitoring**|Remote monitoring is the foundation for all IoT solutions. It helps to monitor products and systems to collect performance data and diagnose issues remotely. | Remote monitoring solutions of freight or equipment in the logistics industry help to reduce servicing costs, improve up-time, and increase user satisfaction. |
|**Predictive maintenance**|Predictive maintenance is a power use case that is common for device manufacturers. The solution monitors the condition of in-service equipment to predict when maintenance is performed vs. time-based systems. At its core, this is remote monitoring and machine learning. | The manufacturing industry utilizes predictive maintenance to monitor equipment to determine if components are performing properly or can remain in-service. |
|**Facilities management**|Facilities management enables the ability to optimize usage, user experience, and energy consumption in any facility. For example, Digital Twin is a variant of IoT Hub that provides spatial intelligence capabilities for scenarios like facilities management. | The energy industry uses facilities management combined with remote monitoring to manage energy usage to reduce cost, optimize, and compare performance. |
|**Connected manufacturing**|Connected manufacturing is the ability to manage production lines (or other commercial applications) using embedded devices and sensors. | The renewable energy industry uses real-time performance monitoring of solar panel production lines to improve efficiency through preventative maintenance and failure prediction for controlled shutdowns. This solution is the combination of remote monitoring and predictive maintenance, but with support from industrial equipment to work together securely. |
|**Fleet management**|Fleet management is the ability to monitor a fleet of vehicles with connect sensors, such as planes, trains, trucks, cars, forklifts, etc. |  The transportation industry uses real-time visibility to track location and speed of vehicles, resulting in fewer insurance claims and lower fuel costs. They enable IoT assets such as “connected” or “smart vehicle solutions” for tracking. |
