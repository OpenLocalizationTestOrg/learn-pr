Organizations preparing to digitally transform their business must determine how to modernize existing applications and infrastructure to achieve business goals. There are many paths towards modernization—your organization could lift-and-shift (migrate) your servers to the cloud and update the tools later, or you could start from scratch (modernize) and build new applications for the cloud. These decisions are unique to your company and your business goals. The retail industry, for example, is seeing benefits as they migrate their workloads to the cloud to provide a more personalized customer shopping experience. Retailers can collect and analyze customers’ shopping patterns and make recommendations on additional purchasing options.
