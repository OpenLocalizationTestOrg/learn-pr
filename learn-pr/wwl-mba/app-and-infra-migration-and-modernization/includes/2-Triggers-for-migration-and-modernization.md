Keeping up with the speed of change in the business world is challenging. Technology is opening entirely new markets and creating innovative ways to serve customers. More and more organizations push digital innovation beyond experimentation to drive competitive advantage and continuously deliver value. At the same time, app-driven disruption provides exponential growth opportunities.

Businesses that decide to adopt the cloud are often motivated by specific triggers.

Now that we’ve reviewed modernization triggers, let’s look at one example of a company investing in application modernization to enable new business opportunities to differentiate themselves from their competitors.

## Transformation example: Alaska Airlines

A great online shopping experience begins with great software, and Alaska Airlines uses Microsoft Azure services—microservices and Windows Server Containers with Docker—to launch new e-commerce features faster: in minutes, not days. Travelers get new offers sooner, which in turn translates to happier customers and higher revenues. By running its e-commerce engine in Azure in hybrid fashion, Alaska can also scale more easily and cost-effectively, ensuring its sites run at the optimum point of performance and cost.

As you saw in the video, Alaska Airlines migrated from a traditional online shopping experience hosted in physical machines to running their applications on Azure. This shift allows Alaska Airlines to deploy faster, iterate rapidly, and experiment to find out what works best for their customers.
