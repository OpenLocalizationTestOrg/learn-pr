In this unit, we’ll cover how to rehost your applications through migration—moving the application, infrastructure, and data to the cloud as-is.

## Rehosting applications

Rehosting is also referred to as a lift-and-shift migration. The application is moved from an on-premises server into the IaaS environment of Azure, avoiding modifications to the system. With this approach, cloud benefits are quickly unlocked, and you can take advantage of advanced cloud capabilities, such as autoscaling and improved resiliency, while gradually modernizing afterwards.

Microsoft has designed the Azure IaaS solution to offer a large set of advantages, just by lifting-and-shifting an application into the cloud. Here are some advantages:

- **Infrastructure for all workloads:** Built to run all types of workloads from custom-built to purchased software.
- **Hybrid by design:** Capabilities to connect your on-premises and cloud solutions.
- **Secure and well-managed:** Advanced management tools for all your solutions.
- **Cost effective:** Less expensive than AWS.

As you saw in the video, Azure offers an array of comprehensive benefits. You can consult with a partner, or Microsoft, to help you migrate to Azure.

Earlier in this unit, we covered that software end of support is a common migration trigger.  See below for how you can take advantage of the end of support for Windows Server 2008 to start your journey to the cloud.

## Prepare for Windows Server 2008 and SQL Server 2008 end of support (EOS)

There is no better time to move to the cloud.  On January 14, 2020, support for Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2 will end. On July 9, 2019, support for SQL Server 2008 and 2008 R2 will end.  End of support means there will be no further updates, including regular security updates.  With the increasing sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks, running apps and data on unsupported versions of Windows Server and SQL Server can create significant security and compliance risks.  

### Migrate to Azure, get free extended security updates

End of support is an ideal time to transform your business with the cloud, but we know that it can be hard to upgrade everything before the end of support timeline. One alternative is to rehost these workloads to Azure with no application code change. Servers can be moved to run in IaaS Virtual Machines (VMs) without having to change the software or configurations on the workstations.

Once you migrate Windows Server 2008 or 2008 R2 to Azure, we will provide free extended security updates for the Azure-hosted versions for up to 3 years after the end of support for the stand-alone versions.  This gives you more time to plan your roadmap for modernizing your applications, including upgrading to newer versions such as SQL Server 2017 or Windows Server 2016 to utilize the rich set of platform and data services available in Azure.

## Move your SAP workloads to Azure

According to research firm Gartner Inc., two-thirds of all business leaders believe that their companies must pick up the pace of digitalization to remain competitive. As leaders in enterprise software, SAP and Microsoft are aligning closely to provide customers with the safe and trusted path to digital transformation.

You can run your SAP applications in the robust and reliable Azure cloud environment that features the broadest global footprint, the largest compliance portfolio, embedded security, enterprise-grade SLAs, and industry-leading support. Azure supports the largest SAP HANA workloads of any hyperscale cloud provider.

Microsoft is running SAP S/4HANA on Azure for their internal operations. Microsoft is transforming its internal systems—which include legacy SAP finance applications—and will implement the SAP S/4HANA Finance solution running on Azure. Microsoft also plans to connect SAP S/4HANA to Azure AI and analytics services for more efficient financial reporting and more powerful decision-making. SAP is migrating more than a dozen business-critical systems to Azure for the optimal efficiencies, flexibility and innovation the platform offers. This includes the SAP S/4HANA software supporting Concur, an SAP company.

To succeed in today’s disruptive business environment, you can’t afford to wait to start planning the move of your SAP systems to the cloud. By marrying your SAP data to other data on Azure now, you’ll be able to use end-to-end, real-time insights to quickly enter new markets, fend off disruptive competition, improve your margins, and grow your business right away.
