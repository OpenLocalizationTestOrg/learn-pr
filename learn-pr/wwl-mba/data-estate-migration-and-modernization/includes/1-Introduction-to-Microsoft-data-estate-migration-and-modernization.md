### What is data estate migration and modernization?

A **data estate** refers to all the data an organization owns, regardless of where it is stored. When you migrate this data to the cloud or modernize your environment on-premises, you can gain important insights to fuel innovation. This modern data environment allows you to empower employees, engage customers, optimize operations, and transform products.

The massive growth in data and the increasing need for everyone to get immediate insights demands a fast and highly-scalable data platform. When cloud, data, and AI work together, they offer new and exceptional opportunities for people and organizations to innovate, grow, and achieve more than ever before. For instance, the healthcare industry is changing the way they interact with patients through the use of the cloud, data, and AI to enhance self-care through connected medical devices. The industry is moving to data modernization by analyzing data to offer personalized patient care often resulting in reduced operational costs. This growth of data is driving the need for data modernization.

#### What is data modernization?

Data modernization refers to the process of restructuring how data is collected, stored, and managed to take advantage of new technologies. Events such as software end of support and datacenter consolidation can be opportunities to modernize a business.

Organizations typically have data estates stored in legacy applications or in data lakes. Digital transformation starts with data, but the increasing volume, velocity, and variety of data makes it more and more complex to draw valuable insights and make informed decisions.

Microsoft solutions can help migrate servers, databases, and applications to modern platforms on-premises or to Azure. As data types, volumes, applications, and architectures change, you can modernize your data with Azure Data Services.
