### What is globally distributed data? 

Businesses need applications that are available to customers wherever they are around the world. With globally distributed data, applications can transparently replicate data anywhere in the world, enabling a fast response time and high availability.

Azure Cosmos DB (Microsoft’s NoSQL database) is a database for building fast, scalable applications with native support for NoSQL.

Azure Cosmos DB was built from the ground up with **global distribution** and **horizontal scale** at its core. It offers turnkey global distribution across any number of Azure regions by transparently scaling and replicating data wherever the users are. Organizations pay for what they use, and are supported by comprehensive service level agreements.

> [!TIP]
> Horizontal scaling refers to adding or removing databases in order to adjust capacity or overall performance, also called “scaling out.”

To keep up with global growth and deliver the best possible online experience, ASOS transformed its e-commerce platform to run in the cloud.

### The ASOS recommendations engine

The ASOS recommendations engine supports offline training and scoring of a range of machine learning models. These models are used to calculate a product’s relevancy in real-time and determine the likelihood of a customer viewing, saving, adding to their cart, and ultimately buying a product.

The following diagram illustrates how the ASOS recommendations platform works.

Now that you have seen an application of globally distributed data through the example of ASOS, let’s move to our next topic: cloud scale analytics.
