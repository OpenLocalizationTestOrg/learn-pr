### What is data modernization? 

Data modernization is the process of making progressive changes to the way you collect, store, and manage data so that customers can unlock new insights to drive their digital transformation initiatives. Azure provides organizations with many options for modernizing data. Below are a few approaches that organizations can take to move their data from on-premises to Azure.

- **Managed Instance**: With Azure SQL Database Managed Instance, databases can be easily migrated with little to no code changes and near zero downtime. Customers also benefit from running their databases in a fully managed service environment, with capabilities like automatic patching and version updates, automated backups, high availability, and reduced management overhead. With Azure Hybrid Benefit and reserved capacity pricing, customers can save up to 80% compared to Amazon Web Services (AWS) when migrating to Azure SQL Database.

- **SQL on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Organizations with certain requirements or preferences may choose to run SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines. This includes those who desire operating system and database control or have BI requirements such as SQL Server Reporting Services or ISV certification. Customers can save up to 43% compared to AWS when migrating their databases to SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines.

- **Open Source Software (OSS)**: Organizations using OSS databases can move to the Microsoft fully-managed Azure offerings for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB. Azure Database Migration Service eases migrations from on-premises to these cloud offerings, helping organizations move to Azure. With these OSS offerings, customers can save up to 50% on high availability compared to AWS. 

- **Hybrid**: Many organizations like to manage their data estate in a hybrid fashion, with some server applications running on-premises and some in the cloud. Microsoft offers the most consistent set of products and services enabling organizations to seamlessly manage their data in both environments. Microsoft SQL Server 2017 can meet the needs of modernizing your on-premises data estate, and is a step towards to modernizing to Azure.

### How does data modernization to Azure work? 

Azure SQL Database is the intelligent, fully-managed relational cloud database service with the broadest SQL Server engine compatibility and industry-leading total cost of ownership (TCO).

#### Azure SQL Database Managed Instance

Azure SQL Database Managed Instance is an expansion of the existing SQL Database service. It is designed to enable friction-free database migration to a fully-managed database service, with little to no code changes and near zero downtime.

#### What does data modernization to Azure look like?

Using the Azure Database Migration Service, databases can be modernized to Azure SQL Database, SQL Server on Azure VMs, Azure Cosmos DB, or Azure Database for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB.

The following diagram illustrates how databases can be modernized.  Azure Database Migration Services can take your existing on-premises databases and migrate them to equivalent database services on Azure.

### What about hybrid and on-premises solutions?

Data modernization on-premises is the process of making progressive changes to the way you collect, store, and manage data without moving everything to the cloud all at once.

Many organizations have made significant investments in on-premises infrastructure and will continue to operate on-premises or hybrid environments for years to come. Opportunities to modernize your organization’s data estate can include events such as software end of support and datacenter consolidation.  

Microsoft SQL Server 2017 can meet the needs of modernizing your on-premises data estate, and is a step towards modernizing to Azure. Partners and Microsoft can help migrate servers, databases, and applications to modern platforms on-premises or to the cloud.
