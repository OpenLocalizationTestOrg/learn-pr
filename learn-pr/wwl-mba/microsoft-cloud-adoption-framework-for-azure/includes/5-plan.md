How the cloud can advance your business strategy depends on your situation. The cloud delivers fundamental technology benefits that can aid in executing multiple business strategies. Using cloud-based approaches can improve business agility, reduce costs, accelerate time to market, and even allow businesses to quickly expand into new markets.

As your organization moves forward in your cloud adoption journey, proper planning is key to your success. Your organization already has technology investments, so you must understand your current state and then develop a prioritization plan for your cloud journey.

In this stage, you focus on two main actions:

- **Rationalize your digital estate:** Understand the organization's current digital estate to maximize return and minimize risks by running a Workload Assessment.
- **Create your cloud adoption plan:** Develop a plan where prioritized workloads are defined and aligned with business outcomes.

## Rationalize your digital estate

A digital estate is the collection of IT assets that power business processes and supporting operations. To begin cloud rationalization of the digital estate, inventory all the digital assets the organization owns today. Then, evaluate each asset to determine the best way to migrate or modernize each component to the cloud.

During this process, we recommend that you proceed incrementally, application by application. Don’t make decisions too broadly or too early across the entire application portfolio.

You might also hear cloud rationalization referred to as the Five Rs. There are five options for cloud rationalization:

Also known as a lift-and-shift migration, a rehost effort moves a current state asset to the chosen cloud provider, with minimal change to overall architecture.

- Reduce capital expense.
- Free up datacenter space.
- Achieve rapid return on investment in the cloud.

Refactor also refers to the application development process of refactoring code to allow an application to deliver on new business opportunities.

- Experience faster and shorter updates.

When aging applications aren't compatible with the cloud, they might need to be rearchitected to produce cost and operational efficiencies in the cloud.

Unsupported, misaligned, or out-of-date on-premises applications might be too expensive to carry forward. A new code base with a cloud-native design might be the most appropriate and efficient path.

- Accelerate innovation.
- Build apps faster.

Sometimes the best approach is to replace the current application with a hosted application that meets all functionality required in the cloud.

- Standardize around industry best practices.
- Accelerate adoption of business process-driven approaches.
- Reallocate development investments into applications that create competitive differentiation or advantages.

Because every application is unique, there’s no single set of steps to follow for cloud rationalization. A Workload Assessment helps to identify which applications require minor changes in code and which need a complete redesign to make them cloud ready. During this important assessment, each application is examined against the broader portfolio. Each application’s value is prioritized and a plan is created for each one’s future use.

## Remove rationalization roadblocks

To remove rationalization as a roadblock to migration, the Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure suggests an incremental rationalization approach. In this approach, the Five Rs are initially reduced to one of two Rs. If the cloud adoption motivations are aligned to migration motivations, a Rehost rationalization is applied to all workloads. If motivations are aligned to innovation motivations, a Refactor rationalization is applied.

Having one initial rationalization allows for initial business planning based on a documented assumption that will later be tested.

Fortunately, a plan for every application often isn't required to start a transformation journey. In an incremental model, the* Power of 10 *provides a good starting point. In this model, select the first 10 applications to be migrated. Those 10 applications should contain a mixture of simple and complex applications.*|

## Create your cloud adoption plan

As you develop a business justification model for your organization's cloud journey, identify business outcomes that can be mapped to specific cloud capabilities and business strategies to reach the desired state of transformation. Documenting all these outcomes and business strategies serves as the foundation for your organization’s cloud adoption plan.

Key steps to build this plan are to:

- Review sample business outcomes. Identify any business outcomes that directly align with the targeted business strategy. Document those outcomes in the provided business outcome template to share with internal partners during the transformation journey.
- Identify the learning metrics that best represent progress toward the identified business outcomes. It might be necessary to engage the CIO or members of the IT team to select relevant metrics based on the current environment.
- Establish a financial model that aligns with the outcomes and learning metrics.
- Document and incorporate the digital estate in the current environment to populate the financial model. This step establishes the investment criteria, the time to break even, and the return on investment (ROI).

First, prepare your people with proper technical training and get ready to adjust your business processes to the cloud. Second, define your digital end estate and prioritize applications to get started.*|

- There are two main actions during the Plan phase:
  - Rationalize your digital estate.
  - Create your cloud adoption plan.
- In the Plan phase, there are five options for cloud rationalization: Rehost, Refactor, Rearchitect, Rebuild/New, and Replace. During this process, we recommend that you proceed incrementally.
- The cloud delivers fundamental technology benefits that can aid in executing multiple business strategies. Using cloud-based approaches can improve basic business agility, reduce costs, accelerate time to market, and even allow businesses to quickly expand into new markets.

Let’s talk next about how to prepare your organization, your business processes, and your environment for your cloud adoption journey.
