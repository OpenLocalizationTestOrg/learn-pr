Organizations adopt the cloud to help drive business transformation, such as processes and product improvement, market growth, and increased profitability. Let’s look at the most common motivation triggers for cloud adoption.

Across organizations of all types, sizes, and industries, the decision to invest in cloud technologies is often tightly connected to a critical business event. The reason for this connection is because the cloud might enable the appropriate solution for the event. Proper cloud technology implementation might turn a reactive response into an innovation opportunity to drive growth for the organization.

When organizations address these business events, the expected business outcomes will determine the organization's cloud journey. The journey involves migration or innovation: 

- The migration journey is largely focused on completing a migration of existing on-premises applications to the cloud. 
- The innovation journey is frequently linked to migration because it's common for the migrated applications to undergo modernization efforts that drive business and product innovation.

Organizations find different triggers to adopt new technologies like Azure. Some triggers drive the organization to migrate current applications. Other triggers require creation of new capabilities, products, and experiences.

Some common migration and innovation triggers include:

- Preparation for new technical capabilities
- Gaining scale to meet market or geographic demands
- Cost savings
- Reduction in vendor or technical complexity
- Optimization of internal operations
- Increased business agility
- Improvements to customer experiences or engagements
- Transformation of products or services
- Disruption of the market from new products or services
