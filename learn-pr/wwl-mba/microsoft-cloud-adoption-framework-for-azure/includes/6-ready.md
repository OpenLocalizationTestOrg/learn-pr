We just looked at how a business plan aligned to a digital estate rationalization can ensure you know why you’ll benefit from moving to the cloud. Cloud adoption is a strategic change that requires involvement from both business decision makers and end users. Now, let’s talk about how to get your organization ready for this journey:

- **Define skills and support readiness:** Create and implement a skills-readiness plan to:
    - Address current gaps.
    - Ensure that IT and business people are ready for the change and the new technologies. 
    - Define support needs.
- **Create your landing zone:** Set up a migration target in the cloud to handle prioritized applications.

## Define skills and support readiness

Ensuring that your organization's business leaders are well prepared and educated on cloud concepts, terminology, and business value is critical to a successful cloud adoption journey. A solid foundation among business leaders and teams within the organization creates a healthy, connected organization. You want to avoid silos and obstacles while you prepare the organization for success in their cloud adoption journey.

IT staff members might feel anxious about their roles and positions as they realize that a different set of skills is needed to support cloud solutions. However, agile employees are a great asset to the adoption. They explore and learn new cloud technologies and can lead the adoption of cloud services. They also help an organization understand and embrace the associated changes.

Microsoft and partners offer a variety of options to help organizations develop these strategic skills with Microsoft Azure services. Training resources are available on Microsoft Learn to make this transition even easier. You can access specific learning resources for business users, solution architects, cloud administrators, and developers.

Before anything gets tested, deployed, or potentially broken, explore Azure Support options. Choose the plan that best fits your needs, whether you're a developer just starting your cloud journey or a large organization deploying business-critical, strategic applications.

## Create your landing zone

Before you begin to build and deploy solutions with Azure services, make sure your environment is ready. The term *landing zone* is used to describe an environment that's provisioned and prepared to host workloads in a cloud environment, such as Azure. A fully functioning landing zone is the final deliverable of any iteration of the Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure methodology.

These resources include management groups, resource groups, and subscriptions. Azure offers many services that help you organize resources, control costs, and secure and manage your organization’s Azure subscription. Azure Cost Management also provides a few ways to help you predict, analyze, and manage costs.*|

There are major considerations when you implement any landing zone. These considerations, commonly referred to as Azure foundations, can be broken into further categories. These types of considerations include hosting and governance.

### Hosting considerations

All landing zones provide structure to hosting options. There are four decision areas to be considered when you host your landing zone:

- **Compute decisions:** Align compute options with the purpose of the landing zone to minimize operational complexity.
- **Networking decisions:** Choose the networking services, tools, and architectures to support your organization's workload, governance, and connectivity requirements.
- **Azure Storage guidance:** Select the right Azure Storage solution to support your usage scenarios.
- **Correct SQL Server option in Azure:** Choose the PaaS or IaaS solution that best supports your SQL Server workloads.

### Governance considerations for security and compliance

Enforce and automate policies and security settings that help you follow applicable legal requirements:

  - **Azure Policy:** Create, assign, and manage policies.
  - **Azure Security Center:** See a unified view of security across your applications, and review recommendations to fix issues before they can be exploited.
- **Stay current with Azure:** Track product updates so you can take a proactive approach to change management.

Now that you know how to prepare your environment, define the order or prioritization of all applications you want to deploy in the cloud.

Implementing the first application is key to learning and testing with confidence, as your cloud adoption journey starts. Use a two-pronged approach to select it:

- **Business criteria:** Identify an application currently in operation where the owner has a strong motivation to move to the cloud.
- **Technical criteria:** Select an application that has minimum dependencies and can be moved as a small group of assets.

It’s important to select an application that doesn't interact with secure data. Carefully consider which application is a good candidate. As you plan subsequent releases and additional applications are deployed to the cloud, you create the first prioritized migration application and the first prioritized release backlog. Over time, you create and continue to shape the optimal environment for future deployments.*|

- Cloud adoption is a strategic change that requires involvement from both business decision makers and end users. When you get your organization ready for the cloud adoption journey, it's important to define skills and support readiness, and create your landing zone.
- When you define skills and support readiness, create and implement a skills-readiness plan to address current gaps, ensure that people are ready for the change, and define support needs.
- The process of creating your landing zone sets up a migration target in the cloud to handle prioritized applications. When you implement any landing zones, refer to the Azure foundations considerations categories of hosting and governance.

You’ve learned how critical it is to ready your people, business processes, and environment to achieve a successful outcome on your cloud adoption journey. Next, you'll learn about how to implement your cloud adoption plan based on either a migration or innovation path.
