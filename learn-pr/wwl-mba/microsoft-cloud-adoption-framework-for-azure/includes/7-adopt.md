At this point, you've established your business justification and defined your business outcomes. You've prepared your organization. Your people and your Azure environment are ready to deploy your prioritized applications. You're ready to adopt cloud technologies following the selected digital estate rationalization path.

As discussed, your organization has unique motivations to adopt the cloud. They all converge into *migration* or *innovation* to the cloud.

## Cloud migration

Cloud migration is the process of moving existing digital assets to a cloud platform. Existing assets are replicated to the cloud with minimal modifications. After an application or workload becomes operational in the cloud, users are transitioned from the existing solution to the cloud solution.

Conversely, some benefits of the cloud might not be realized without additional future modification. Enterprises and mid-market customers use this approach to accelerate the pace of change, avoid planned capital expenditures, and reduce ongoing operational costs.*|

The strategy and tools you use to migrate an application to Azure largely depend on your business motivations, technology strategies, and timelines. Your decisions are also based on a deep understanding of the application and the assets to be migrated. These assets include infrastructure, apps, and data. This decision tree serves as high-level guidance to help you select the best tools to use based on migration decisions.

To guide incremental execution during the transition to the end state, this model separates migration into two areas of focus.

**Migration preparation:** Establish a rough migration backlog based largely on the current state and desired outcomes:

- **Business outcomes:** The key business objectives that drive this migration. They're defined in the Plan stage.
- **Digital estate estimate:** A rough estimate of the number and condition of workloads to be migrated. It's defined in the Plan stage.
- **Roles and responsibilities:** A clear definition of the team structure, separation of responsibilities, and access requirements. They're defined in the Ready stage.
- **Change management requirements:** The cadence, processes, and documentation required to review and approve changes. They're defined in the Ready stage.

These initial inputs shape the migration backlog for the cloud adoption journey. The output of the migration backlog is a prioritized list of applications to migrate to the cloud. That list shapes the execution of the cloud migration process. Over time, it will also grow to include much of the documentation needed to manage change.

**Migration process:** Each cloud migration activity is contained in one of the following processes, as it relates to the migration backlog:

- **Assess:** Evaluate an existing asset and establish a plan for migration of the asset.
- **Migrate:** Replicate the functionality of an asset in the cloud.
- **Optimize:** Balance the performance, cost, access, and operational capacity of a cloud asset.
- **Secure and manage:** Ensure a cloud asset is ready for ongoing operations.

## Cloud innovation

Cloud-native apps and data accelerate development and experimentation cycles. Older apps can take advantage of many of the same cloud-native benefits by modernizing the solution or components of the solution. Modern DevOps and software development lifecycle (SDLC) approaches that use cloud technology shorten the time from idea to product transformation. Combined, these tools invite the customer into the process to create shorter feedback loops and better customer experiences.

Modern approaches to infrastructure deployment, operations, and governance are rapidly bridging the gaps between development and operations. Modernization and innovation in the IT portfolio create tighter alignment with DevOps and accelerate innovations across the digital estate and application portfolio.

- Cloud migration is the process of moving existing digital assets to a cloud platform. The Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure separates migration into two areas of focus:
  - Migration preparation
  - Migration process
- Each cloud migration activity is contained during one of the following processes, as it relates to the migration backlog: assess, migrate, optimize, and secure. Then, you manage each backlog asset.
- Modernization and innovation in the IT portfolio create tighter alignment with DevOps and accelerate innovations across the digital estate and application portfolio.

You've learned how to plan, get ready, and start to deploy your first applications to the cloud. Now let’s talk about how to operate in the cloud.
