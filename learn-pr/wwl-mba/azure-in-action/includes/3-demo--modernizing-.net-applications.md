### Key points

- Azure offers tools and capabilities that simplify the process of migrating your existing workloads to the cloud. In the cloud, you can immediately take advantage of cloud scale and elasticity and easily modernize to align to changing business goals.

- Azure App Service lets you easily migrate applications to Azure by using the publishing tools available in Visual Studio. Visual Studio is a common development tool that can automatically create necessary resources, like Azure SQL databases.

- After an application is running in Azure App Service, administrators can take advantage of many benefits. Here are just a few of the options that you can configure by using Azure App Service:

  - **Application authentication or authorization.** Fully control access to an app by activating authentication providers like a Microsoft account, Facebook, Google, and Twitter. You can even put your app behind an Active Directory tenant.

  - **Networking.** Connect to on-premises resources, like databases, and fully customize security by using networking policy to define how traffic and data flows through an app.

  - **Scale up.** Increase the size of an instance by adding more resources.

  - **Scale out.** Increase the number of instances running.

- Azure Logic Apps enables you to modernize an application without changing the production code. You can automate and scale with minimal disruption and simplify the creation of workflows that integrate apps and data across cloud services and on-premises systems.

Now that you've experienced Azure in action, let's check what you've learned.
