## Introduction

Welcome to the demonstration of migrating Windows Server and SQL Server to Azure. Azure offers solutions that help organizations assess on-premises apps, allowing you to discover servers, visualize dependencies, and confidently plan and implement server and service migration to Azure.

Contoso, Ltd., is a technology company that’s planning to rehost its IT support web application by using a “lift-and-shift” migration strategy. The company is currently running the web application on Windows Server 2008 R2 and SQL Server 2008 R2 platforms virtualized in VMware.

Victor, Cloud Administrator at Contoso, Ltd., is going to rehost the application web servers to Azure IaaS virtual machines and move the SQL Server database to a fully managed Azure database service.

You’ve just seen how Azure Migrate, Azure Database Migration Service, and Azure Site Recovery can help your organization assess its on-premises applications for migration and then rehost these applications to Azure.

### Key points

- Use Azure Migrate to easily discover and assess your on-premises virtual machines. When you use Azure Migrate for this process, your IT department won't need to manually count servers and determine specs.

- The Azure Migrate appliance will help you evaluate your physical on-premises servers and work with vSphere to assess virtual servers.

- The Azure Migrate appliance gathers metadata from on-premises servers running both Windows and Linux and sends it to the migration project. Azure Migrate then uses the appliance data to make application-specific migration recommendations, including cost estimates for migration and for operation in the cloud.

- Azure Hybrid Benefit allows you to capitalize on your existing Windows licensing investments by providing discounts for VMs turned on in Azure.

- Azure Database Migration Service is an end-to-end solution for moving on-premises SQL Server databases to a managed SQL environment with minimal downtime. It replaces multiple tools with a single comprehensive service.

- After you move to Azure, you can save as much as 80 percent by reserving capacity rather than using the pay-as-you-go model.

- Azure Site Recovery offers a method for migrating your on-premises VMs to the cloud without taking down the servers. It replicates the VMs from a primary site (on-premises) to a secondary location (Azure).

- Connecting to a load balancer in Azure keeps your servers from bogging down, allowing a smooth flow of traffic. The availability set ensures that your site is always up and running without the need for duplicate servers.

Next, we'll see how easy it is to migrate and modernize an application without changing the code.
