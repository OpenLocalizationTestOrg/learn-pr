*The cloud* is a vast network of remote servers around the globe that are linked together and operate as a single ecosystem. These servers are designed to store and manage data, run applications, or deliver content or services like streaming videos, web mail, office productivity software, or social media. 

*Cloud computing* is the delivery of computing services—servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, intelligence, and more—over the internet to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. We live in a cloud era. Organizations are using the computing power of the cloud to change the way they consume technology and run their businesses. 

Azure is being built as the world’s computer, meaning it's the computing fabric that connects applications to the *intelligent edge* of connected systems and devices that gather and analyze data. Azure uses artificial intelligence (AI) technology to provide intelligent computing power to these applications, systems, and connected devices across the world. This connection between the Azure *intelligent cloud* and the intelligent edge gives organizations the ability to create a new class of connected applications and experiences that drive breakthrough business outcomes. By implementing the Cloud Operating Model, you can ensure that your organization will fully take advantage of Azure to meet your digital transformation goals.

In this module, you will:

- Learn how to use the Cloud Operating Model to identify where you are in the digital transformation journey.
- Identify triggers and opportunities for cloud migration.
- Recognize the components needed to develop a digital transformation strategy around your business, people, and technology.

We'll start by providing an overview of the Cloud Operating Model so that you can recognize where you are in your cloud adoption journey and identify strategies for the seamless adoption of cloud computing.
