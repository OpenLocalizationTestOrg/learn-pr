### What is a technology strategy?

*Technology strategy* is the process of selecting the platform you want to use for your cloud migration and evaluating your application portfolio to determine whether you want to migrate each app, modernize it, retire it, or rebuild it as a cloud-native application.  You'll use your business strategy and long-term business goals to determine your technology strategy. Your people strategy will drive the change.

Before selecting the cloud approach that’s right for your organization, it’s important to understand key concepts and models. Most important is the notion that computing is provided as a service. This means that the cloud enables a set of capabilities that can be rented, used for a period of time, increased as more are needed, and dispensed with when they're no longer needed. You pay for what you use and no more.

Because every application is unique, there’s no single set of steps to follow for modernization. That's why it's important to conduct an *Application Portfolio Assessment* to identify which applications are ready to modernize, which require minor changes in code, and which need a complete redesign to make them cloud ready. You'll start by assessing your current application portfolio, prioritizing each application’s value, creating a plan for each one’s future use, and executing on your plan. Choosing the right migration and modernization approach for the various applications in your portfolio can help you extract maximum value from cloud-enabled and innovative technologies. 

There are five *migration strategies* to consider: *rehost*, *refactor*, *rearchitect*, *rebuild*, and *replace*. The following sections summarize these five strategies, their benefits, when you might want to use them, and which Microsoft solutions and technologies support them.

### Rehost (migration)

Often called “lift-and-shift” migration, rehosting is a no-code option that lets you migrate your existing applications to Azure quickly.

#### Benefits

- Minimizes application downtime due to hardware failure, isolated management of IT infrastructure, expensive and time-intensive procurement processes, inefficient disaster recovery, and inconsistent archiving.
- The fastest way to migrate  apps because it doesn’t require any code changes, minimizing risk and cost.

#### Potential Microsoft solutions and technologies

- Azure IaaS solutions

----------------------------

### Refactor (modernization)

Refactoring is the process of transforming an existing application by adding cloud-enabled and innovation capabilities to the application while changing code minimally.

#### Benefits
- Requires minimal changes to existing code to enable the use of platform as a service (PaaS) capabilities.

#### Potential Microsoft solutions and technologies
- Azure Kubernetes Service (container technology)

----------------------

### Rearchitect (modernization)

Rearchitecting means modifying or extending an existing application’s code base to optimize it for a cloud platform and better scalability. 

#### Benefits
- Group application functionalities into modules that can then be scaled up or down and tested, deployed, and managed independently. 
- If any code breaks, only that module or function is affected. The rest of the application remains available.
- When a module or function no longer meets business requirements, you can swap it out for a better option.

#### Potential Microsoft solutions and technologies 
- Azure microservices-based technologies
 
-----------------------

### Rebuild (modernization)

Rebuilding is using Azure cloud technologies to completely reconstruct an app.

#### Benefits
- Increased productivity that takes advantage of PaaS technologies.
- Enables rapid application development with improved innovation and security.
- Does not require original source code.
- Ability to build on new platform.

#### Potential Microsoft solutions and technologies 
- Azure serverless computing technologies 

----------------------

### Replace (modernization)

Replacement is the retirement of your existing on-premises application by replacing it with a SaaS application.

#### Benefits
- Use existing SaaS applications that better meet your existing and future business needs.
- Provides uniform management tools to monitor and manage the application.

#### Potential Microsoft solutions and technologies 
- Microsoft SaaS solutions like Microsoft 365
- Microsoft partner and open source SaaS solutions

Now that we’ve reviewed the application migration strategies, consider which of these strategies might be optimal for your organization's applications. Next, let's see what you've learned about the Cloud Operating Model with a knowledge check.
