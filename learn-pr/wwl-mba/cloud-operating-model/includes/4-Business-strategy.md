In the last unit, we identified common *modernization triggers* for moving to the cloud. Now, let’s explore how to translate those triggers into a *business strategy* for cloud adoption. A strong business strategy will help you stay focused on your path toward digital transformation and realize business value more quickly than your competition.

When you're building a business strategy for cloud adoption, you should consider things like financial impact, turnaround time, global reach, performance, and more. Here are three key areas you'll need to focus on:

- **Articulating business value:** Translate the cloud adoption triggers into value statements for your journey.

- **Developing a financial plan:** Make sure you have the financial reasoning and support for your journey.

- **Managing governance, risk, and compliance:** Show how you'll manage the governance structure as well as compliance and risk for your company and data.

### Articulating business value

When you identify a modernization trigger, you know that your business is not maximizing value in one or more areas. Here are six common business value areas that business decision makers typically use to justify their company’s adoption of cloud computing services:

**Cost**

Cloud computing eliminates the capital expense of buying hardware and software and then setting up and running onsite datacenters. Azure provides flexible purchase and pricing options for its cloud services.

**Speed**

Most cloud computing services are provided as self-service and on-demand services, so even vast amounts of computing resources can be provisioned in minutes. And you can typically implement them with just a few mouse clicks, giving your business flexibility and taking the pressure off of capacity planning.

**Global scale**

One benefit of cloud computing services is the ability to scale elastically. In cloud-speak, that means delivering the right amount of IT resources—for example, more or less computing power, storage, and bandwidth—right when it’s needed and from the right geographic location.

**Productivity**

Onsite datacenters typically require a lot of “racking and stacking”— including hardware setup, software patching, and other time-consuming IT management chores. Cloud computing removes the need for many of these tasks, allowing IT teams to spend their time achieving more important business goals.

**Performance**

The biggest cloud computing services run on a worldwide network of secure datacenters that are regularly upgraded to the latest generation of fast and efficient computing hardware. This offers several benefits over a single corporate datacenter, including reduced network latency for applications and greater economies of scale.

**Reliability**

Cloud computing makes data backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity easier and less expensive because data can be mirrored at multiple redundant sites on the cloud provider’s network.

### Developing a financial plan

Cloud computing represents a big shift—its business strategy is conceptual and doesn’t become real until the numbers get plugged in. Financial planning for cloud adoption requires organizations to decide whether to expand on-premises capabilities or move certain workloads and functions off-premises to cloud-delivered services.

This graphic depicts the benefits to be realized by a datacenter migration to the cloud—cost reduction, better performance, and reliability.

![Cost management considerations of datacenter expansion to cloud-first mentality: eliminating capital expenses, using on-demand resources, improving capacity planning, enabling scale up and scale down, moving out of the datacenter business, and improving reliability](../media/cost_management.png)

The chief financial officer (CFO) plays a key role in creating and landing a cloud migration plan. The CFO can drive the value of migration and modernization and create a financial plan for adoption. The CFO can also work with the cloud adoption team to develop cost models that compare IT operations on-premises (in a datacenter) to operations in the cloud. These models should include key measurements to quantify the savings.

Here are some tools to support you in your financial planning:

- **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator:** Use the Azure TCO calculator to estimate the cost savings you can realize by migrating your application workloads to Azure. Simply provide a brief description of your on-premises environment to get an instant report.

- **Pricing calculator:** Estimate your expected monthly bill by using our pricing calculator to track your actual account usage and bill at any time on the billing portal. Set up automatic email billing alerts that notify you if the amount you spend exceeds the amount you configure.

- **Azure Cost Management (by Cloudyn):** Use and manage Azure and other cloud resources through a multiple-cloud cost management solution.

### Managing governance, risk, and compliance

It's critical that your company defines an effective governance structure around your cloud adoption journey to manage compliance and minimize risk across the enterprise. By ensuring that governance, risk, and compliance are tightly interwoven, your company is more likely to build a culture of trust as you move to the cloud, which will speed adoption.

This graphic shows the three-sided relationship among *governance*, *risk*, and *compliance* and the factors that drive each:

![Graphic illustrating the triangular relationship among governance, compliance, and risk in establishing trust](../media/ic-gm08_diagram.png)

Governance, risk management, and compliance (GRC) are three facets that help to ensure that an organization meets its objectives, as detailed here:

- Governance is the combination of processes, established and executed by the directors (or the board of directors), that are used to achieve goals.
- Risk management is predicting, understanding, and mitigating risks that could otherwise hinder or prevent the organization from achieving its objectives.
- Compliance is adherence to policies and procedures as well as laws and regulations.

GRC is a discipline that aims to synchronize information and activity across governance, risk management, and compliance to ensure more efficient operations, facilitate effective information sharing, more effectively report activities, and avoid wasteful overlap.

The goals, therefore, of any GRC program must include the following:

- Keep risk at acceptable levels.
- Maintain availability to systems and services.
- Comply with relevant laws and regulations.
- Protect customer data.

In general, GRC is not normally a new function for the cloud. It extends existing activities. GRC professionals should therefore fully understand the implications that the cloud has for their areas and extend existing practices.

We recognize that every organization has a unique approach to managing governance, risk, and compliance. Azure provides the flexibility to help customers meet their own compliance obligations across regulated industries and markets worldwide. Azure maintains the largest compliance portfolio in the industry, in terms of breadth (total number of offerings) and depth (number of customer-facing services in assessment scope). Azure compliance offerings are grouped into four segments: globally applicable, US government, industry-specific, and region/country specific.

> [!TIP]
> More detailed information about Azure compliance offerings—including audit reports and data protection resources—is available on the Compliance website. You'll find a link to this site in the "Summary and resources" unit at the end of this module.
