We just looked at how a business strategy can ensure you know why you’ll benefit from moving to the cloud. Cloud adoption is a strategic change that requires involvement from both business decision makers and end users. Now, let’s talk about building a people strategy.

### What is a people strategy?

*People strategy* is one of the critical aspects of cloud adoption. It helps you identify the key change leaders in your organization and plan for how they enable digital transformation. It's important to understand that some of those people will have to be trained on the new cloud systems. Additional training is available on Microsoft Learn. Let’s start by exploring how to determine who your key change leaders are and what role they play in a cloud migration.

### Creating a strategic team

A migration journey to the cloud is a strategic decision, one that requires engaging senior members of IT and business leaders from around the organization. They need to understand all aspects of the cloud to decide which of the many options and approaches to take. One of the most effective ways to begin the journey is to create a *Cloud Strategy Team* (CST) consisting of business leaders in finance, IT infrastructure, and application groups, as illustrated in this graphic.

The CST must lead the cloud analysis and experimentation phase. At the start of the cloud adoption analysis, the CST is responsible for reviewing business requirements and capabilities to identify possible use cases for cloud adoption. The CST is also responsible for building or facilitating the creation of architectures and patterns and for providing guidance for deployment of the re-envisioned applications or services. Finally, the CST should manage communications with key stakeholders and promote the program’s success and learnings.

One of the key driving functions in creating this team is to promote long-term commitment to the cloud journey. The team establishes a practice for continuously evaluating and experimenting to help determine the appropriate platform and destination for each application.

One of the first tasks of CST members is to spend time educating themselves, making sure all participants have a similar understanding of cloud technology. For better or worse, the technology comes with its own set of acronyms, so learning to speak a common language early accelerates future conversations. Team members can also spend time familiarizing themselves with the offerings from platform, tool, and cloud application providers.

When the team begins to draft the strategy, members should understand that not all services or applications end up in the public cloud, for various reasons. At the start of the migration journey, the organization will use a hybrid cloud. This means—at least for some time—certain applications remain on-premises and, for cloud transition, co-existence is required.

### Translation of roles, guidance, and training

If IT staff is to function as a change agent supporting current and emerging cloud technologies, IT buy-in for the use and integration of these technologies is needed. For this, staff members need the following:

- An understanding of their roles and of any changes to their current positions.
- Time and resources to explore technologies.
- An understanding of the business case for the technologies.

The most notable transformations are often marked by changes in staff roles. For example, in the age of virtualization, the requirement for individuals working with physical servers diminished and was replaced with a need for virtualization specialists. Similarly, as institutions shift to cloud computing, roles will likely change again. Datacenter specialists might be replaced with cloud financial analysts. Even in cases where IT job titles don't change, the daily work roles will evolve significantly.

Here's a typical mapping of how IT employees can develop the strategic skills necessary to succeed in the cloud computing era:

### IT skills readiness path

IT staff members might feel anxious about their roles and positions as they realize that a different set of skills is needed to support cloud solutions. But agile employees who explore and learn new cloud technologies can lead the adoption of cloud services and help an organization understand and embrace the associated changes. Most roles in the existing business might well shift to new roles and use new skills after cloud adoption.

Microsoft and partners offer a variety of options to help all audiences develop these strategic skills with Microsoft Azure services. Training resources are available on Microsoft Learn to make this transition even easier.
