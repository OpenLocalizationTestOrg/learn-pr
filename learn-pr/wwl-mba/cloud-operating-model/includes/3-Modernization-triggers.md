A *modernization trigger* is an event that initiates the cloud migration journey for an organization. This is where you can identify new opportunities for your business.

### Types of modernization triggers

Let’s look at the most common modernization triggers:

- **Datacenter contracts expiring:** This is a great opportunity for organizations to evaluate if moving to the cloud is a better option than renewing datacenter leases. Generally, moving to the cloud means a cost reduction, better performance, and reliability.

- **Deliver applications and features faster:** It’s easier, faster, and less costly to integrate processes of newly acquired companies into the operations of the buyer company if the transitions take place in a cloud environment.

- **Urgent capacity needs:** Companies can sometimes face an urgent need to scale an application or piece of infrastructure for a period of time. Azure responds to this need with global scaling features.

- **Software or hardware refresh:** Refreshes present a great opportunity to ask if the cloud is a better option. Azure ensures higher productivity and greater performance with lower costs than maintaining on-premises hardware and software.

- **Address security threats:** Cloud providers can recognize sophisticated threats sooner to help keep you protected.

- **Compliance:** Many industries have compliance standards they must meet. Azure is certified in many domestic and international standards.

- **Application innovation to enable new business:** Delivering apps faster is one of the key benefits of moving to the cloud. Tools like DevOps, cloud-based dev/test environments, and other services help with faster development.

- **Software end of support:** Reaching software end of support often means buying licenses for new software and costly hardware to support it, as well as time spent training people to use it. You can move those servers to the cloud to reduce cost, improve performance, and ensure better reliability.
