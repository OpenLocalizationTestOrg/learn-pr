In virtually every industry, new, digitally born companies threaten to disrupt industry incumbents. If you don’t adapt to stay competitive, your competitors will. The taxi industry, for instance, has been fundamentally transformed by the introduction of digitally-powered, ride-on-demand services. Whether you're looking to migrate to the cloud or consider yourself a cloud-native company, Azure delivers unique value that helps keep you ahead of your competition. 

Savvy businesses draw upon data from employees, customers, operations, and products to drive actionable business insights, which is known as the digital feedback loop. Azure can help power your company’s digital feedback loop to make better business decisions through powerful, data-driven insights and intelligence.

To help meet your digital transformation goals, Azure is built on four unique values:
* **productive**
