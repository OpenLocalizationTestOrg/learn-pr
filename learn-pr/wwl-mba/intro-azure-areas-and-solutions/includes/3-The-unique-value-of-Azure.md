Azure is designed to align with your business goals and needs by delivering unique value in four key areas: 

- **Productive**: Improve productivity in your business and with your developers.
- **Hybrid**: Take advantage of the flexibility that the Azure hybrid cloud provides. 
- **Intelligent**: Gain insights and build intelligence into all your solutions.
- **Trusted**: Build and deploy on a platform you can trust.

The value that Azure provides across these four areas ensures that your adoption of the cloud is successful starting on day one, and in the future.

## Productive

The three primary productivity benefits that Azure provides are integrated tooling for developers, over 100 cloud services, and unified management for IT admins.
