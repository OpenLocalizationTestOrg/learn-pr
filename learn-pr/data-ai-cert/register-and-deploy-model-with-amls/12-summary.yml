  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "To tell the Azure ML service the Python modules needed to support your model, you would do which of the following?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Create a YAML file with the module dependency list."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is correct. Hyperparameters control how the model training executes and must be set before model training."
    - content: "Enter the dependencies in the portal."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is not correct. Hyperparameters cannot be determined from the source data."
    - content: "Do nothing.  The dependencies will automatically be configured based on your Python scripts."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is not correct.  A Hyperparameter is set before each model training execution."
  
  - content: "What two functions must your scoring script include?"
    choices: 
    - content: "main() and score()"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is not correct.  main() and score() are not required."
    - content: "base() and train()"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is not correct.  base() and train() are not required."
    - content: "init() and run()"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct.  init() loads the model and run() provides the information needed to define the model call."

  - content: "You have finished testing your model and want to deploy it to a scalable target for general usage.  Which is the best target?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Azure Container Instance (ACI)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is not correct.  Azure Container Instance is a single container useful for model training but less scalable than an Azure Kubernetes cluster."
    - content: "Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct.  Azure Kubernetes Services is an orchestrated cluster of containers that can scale to meet demand."
    - content: "IoT Edge"
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: "That is not correct.  IoT Edge deployment is suitable when you need the model deployed to edge devices for consumption."
