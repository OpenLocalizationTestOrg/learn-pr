Azure SQL Database is a managed relational database service. It supports structures such as relational data and unstructured formats such as spatial and XML data. SQL Database provides online transaction processing (OLTP) that can scale on demand. You'll also find the comprehensive security and availability that you appreciate in Azure database services.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This unit focuses on Azure SQL Database, the _platform as a service_ (PaaS) database offering. Here we don't cover Microsoft SQL Server instances that are installed locally or within an Azure virtual machine (VM). Although these are similar, the configuration and benefits of Microsoft SQL Server differ from those of Azure SQL Database.

## When to use SQL Database

Use SQL Database when you need to scale up and scale down OLTP systems on demand. SQL Database is a good solution when your organization wants to take advantage of Azure security and availability features. Organizations that choose SQL Database also avoid the risks of capital expenditures and of increasing operational spending on complex on-premises systems.

SQL Database can be more flexible than an on-premises SQL Server solution because you can provision and configure it in minutes. Even more, SQL Database is backed up by the Azure service-level agreement (SLA).

## Key features

SQL Database delivers predictable performance for multiple resource types, service tiers, and compute sizes. Requiring almost no administration, it provides dynamic scalability with no downtime, built-in intelligent optimization, global scalability and availability, and advanced security options. These capabilities let you focus on rapid app development and on speeding up your time to market. You no longer have to devote precious time and resources to managing virtual machines and infrastructure.

## Ingesting and processing data

SQL Database can ingest data through application integration from a wide range of developer SDKs. Allowed programming languages include .NET, Python, Java, and Node.js. Beyond applications, you can also ingest data through Transact-SQL (T-SQL) techniques and from the movement of data using Azure Data Factory.

## Queries

Use T-SQL to query the contents of a SQL Database. This method benefits from a wide range of standard SQL features to filter, order, and project the data into the form you need.

## Data security

SQL Database provides a range of built-in security and compliance features. These features help your application meet security and compliance requirements like these:

- Advanced Threat Protection
- SQL Database auditing
- Data encryption
- Azure Active Directory authentication
- Multifactor authentication
- Compliance certification
