The data science process is often completed by a team of people with different roles, which are described in the following sections.

Common tools the data engineer will use include but are not limited to:

- SQL
- Extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) tools
- Apache Hadoop
- MongoDB
- Apache Spark

Common tools the developer will use include but are not limited to:

- HTML
- CSS
- Python
- C#, Java, or JavaScript
- Source code control (Git, Svn)

## Data scientist

The data scientist is responsible for understanding the data, and training and testing the model. They will likely be involved with the other roles as they are at the heart of the process.

Common tools the data scientist will use include but are not limited to:

- Python and related packages
- R and related packages
