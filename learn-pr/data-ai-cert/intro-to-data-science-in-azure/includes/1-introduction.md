In recent years, the term *data science* has become more popular due to the influx of data in all areas of business. Data science is about getting valuable insights from information, and answering questions by analyzing data using statistical methods, computing power, and automation. 

One of the core concepts behind data science is using historical data to predict the future. To do this, you use data values you know to predict something you don't know. However, this requires that you have historical data with the outcome you want to predict and other data that correlates to this outcome. For example, let's say you want to predict the likelihood a person will default on a loan. If you have data points for a history of loans that were repaid versus those that defaulted, and their corresponding data such as income, employment status, and credit rating you can define a model to help predict loan defaults.  

Other examples include predicting a technological problem occurring, or trying to understand the patterns in types of products customers are buying. As you can see, the types of questions that can be answered through data science vary greatly. 

Data science is based on probabilities. So along with getting predicted outcomes, the estimated probability of the outcome is a critical consideration. A business is looking to answer a data-driven question often follow a set of predefined steps known as the *data science process*.
