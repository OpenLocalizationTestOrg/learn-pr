Model deployment is the final stage of the data science procedure. It is often done by a developer, and is usually not part of the data scientist role. Deployment typically means putting the resulting model into an environment where it can be called (or *consumed*) by applications. 

There are many considerations for how you deploy a model. Model deployment can involve many things, but it always depends on how the business is looking to implement the model.

Using our example, the model deployment process could be as simple as choosing to implement the results of the model by stocking the shelves accordingly. It could also be as complex as building an application or integrating results into a website using HTML code.
