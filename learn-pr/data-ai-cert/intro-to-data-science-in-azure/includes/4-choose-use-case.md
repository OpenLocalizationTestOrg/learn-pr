The first step in the data science process is choosing a use case. This step is also commonly referred to as *the business understanding* because it's where a business defines their objectives and business problems. Together, the data science team and the company (stakeholders and employees) set goals and targets for the project. Generally, this is also where they identify the scope of the project.

## Identify the problem

There are many different types of questions that can be solved by data science. Examples include disease insights, sales forecasts, and hardware failures. A company that comes across a question that's answerable with data might decide to bring in a data science team to solve the problem.

In the example of your company, the business problem is that the brooms are selling out before the end of the month. Therefore, the company is looking to stock brooms according to the prediction of broom sales.

## Define the project goals

Defining the project goals and objectives begins with asking relevant and specific questions to understand the scope of the project. Your company wants to resolve their issue with broom sales, but the scope of the project must be defined first. Within the range of the project, the company and your data science team must set goals and objectives such as identifying a deadline and milestones for the project.

## Identify data sources

Most companies have a tremendous amount of data, so it's essential to decide what kind of data is necessary for the project. Then you must determine where it's stored and how to gain access to it. Depending on where the company stores the data, it is typically the data engineers' job to retrieve the data from company's data source, cleanse the data, and then deliver it to the data scientist.

## Summary

Choosing a use case allows the data scientist and their team to work with their company or client to define the objectives for the project. Gaining a business understanding encompasses identifying the problem or question, and what solving the problem may require. This part of the data science process helps all people on the data science team understand their role within the project, and identify the measures for success.
