In this module you learned that data science is a process of getting valuable information, and answering questions by analyzing the data with an emphasis on statistical methods, computing power, and automation. The idea of data science is to use historical data to predict something. To do this, you use data values that you know to predict something you don't know. This requires having historical data that has both the outcome you want to predict and other data that correlates to the outcome value. 

You also learned that the types of questions that can be answered through data science vary greatly. Data science is based on probabilities so along with predicted outcomes, the estimated probability of the outcomes is a critical consideration. 

You learned that when a business is looking to answer a data-driven question, they must follow a set of predefined steps, known as the *data science process*, and know what these steps involve. The process of data science includes more than one role. 

Finally, you learned that the roles within this process are business analyst, data engineer, data scientist, and developer. Even though there can be some overlap, each of these roles are important and play a different part in the process.
