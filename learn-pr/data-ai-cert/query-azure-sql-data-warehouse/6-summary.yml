  - content: "The following query is used to retrieve the sales by business reseller, but the performance of the query is slow. The query is as follows: SELECT S.[SalesAmount] AS [Sales], R.[BusinessType],R.[ResellerName] FROM [FactResellerSales] AS S JOIN [DimReseller] AS R ON S.[ResellerKey] = R.[ResellerKey]. The tables referenced within the query are configured with a distribution of Round_Robin with a clustered columnstore index. The data engineer wants to improve the performance of the query. What operation can be used to improve the performance of the query?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Remove the CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX for both tables."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This answer is incorrect. Removing the CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX for both tables reduces the performance of this query."
    - content: "Change the Distribution to HASH(GeographyKey) for both tables."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This answer is incorrect. Placing Hash distribution on the GeographyKey on both the FactResellerSales and DimReseller won't help the performance of this query."
    - content: "Change the Distribution to HASH(ResellerKey) for both tables."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Placing Hash distribution on the ResellerKey on both the FactResellerSales and DimReseller improves the performance of the query."
