In this module, you learn the most fundamental operation to the Azure SQL Data Warehouse, which is how to query the database. You learn how to read the data from a sample database with the SELECT statement and its clauses.

After being convinced that SQL Data Warehouse can solve the issue of loading the business intelligence solution promptly, report writers at Contoso are still nervous. They ask you, as the data engineer, to ease their concerns at writing reports against a cloud database. 

You want to show the report writers that they can continue to use Transact-SQL statements with the standard clauses. These clauses include `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING`. You know that the major difference in their work is changing a connection string. You create a new SQL Data Warehouse server with a sample database to highlight the connection information with clarity.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Create an Azure SQL Data Warehouse sample database.
- Query the sample database with the SELECT statement and its clauses.
- Use the queries in different client applications, such as SQL Server Management Studio and Power BI.
