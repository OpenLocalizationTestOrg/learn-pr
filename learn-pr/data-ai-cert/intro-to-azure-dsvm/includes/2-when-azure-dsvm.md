Data scientists typically need to install and configure a variety of software for machine learning development. Once created, these environments frequently need to be reconfigured for additional data science projects. The Azure Data Science Virtual Machines (Azure DSVM) makes it easy to maintain consistency in the environments in which you are working.

Additionally, each DSVM provides code samples in the form of Jupyter notebooks and scripts in languages such as Python and R to help you learn about Microsoft on-premises and Azure-based machine learning services.

- Samples in Python explain scenarios such as how to connect with Azure cloud data stores and work with Azure Machine Learning.
- Azure Machine Learning samples that show how to build machine learning and deep learning models with Machine Learning.
- Deep learning samples published by the Cognitive Toolkit team at Microsoft to demonstrate using Microsoft Cognitive Services.
- Samples in R explain how to compare open-source R and Microsoft R. And they explain how to operationalize models with Machine Learning Services (R, Python) in SQL Server.
