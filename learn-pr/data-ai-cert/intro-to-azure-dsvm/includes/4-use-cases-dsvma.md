You can use DSVMs for many different uses.

## Collaborate as a team using DSVMs

By replacing physical machines with cloud-based VMs, the data science team can easily and quickly create and modify a machine learning environment with the same baseline configuration. This ensures that all the data science team members have a consistent development environment.

## Address issues with DSVMs

A data science training class requires students to have an environment with the same software installed and configured so examples and labs work consistently. With the DSVM, the problems caused by package incompatibility and language versions are reduced. The students focus on the data science content, and the trainers don't have to spend class time debugging issues. The VMs can be paused or deleted, so you only pay while the machines are in use. With the DSVM, the users can even train themselves using the preloaded code samples.

## Use on-demand elastic capacity for large-scale projects

Data science hackathons (or *competitions*), or large-scale data modeling and exploration require scaled out hardware capacity, typically for a short duration. The DSVM can help replicate the data science environment on demand, allowing experiments requiring high-powered computing resources to be run.

## Experiment and evaluate on a DSVM

You can use the DSVM to learn about tools and topics such as: 

- Microsoft Machine Learning Server
- SQL Server
- Microsoft Visual Studio tools
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Deep learning tools
- Popular Machine Learning toolkits
- Other new tools popular in the community

Because the DSVM can be set up quickly, you can apply it in short-term usage scenarios such as replicating published experiments, executing demonstrations, following walkthroughs in online sessions, and doing tutorials. Many sample scripts and data are provided to demonstrate how to use various Microsoft products that support data science and machine learning such as SQL Server, Machine Learning Server, Azure Machine Learning service, and Microsoft Cognitive Services.

## Learn about DSVMs and deep learning

You can use the DSVM for training models using deep learning algorithms, and select GPU-based hardware when you create the VM. When training large models, or when you require fast computations, you can switch to a GPU-based VM. The Windows Server 2016 edition of DSVM comes preinstalled with GPU drivers, frameworks, and GPU versions of deep learning frameworks. The Linux edition has deep learning on GPU enabled on both the CentOS and Ubuntu DSVMs. You can deploy the Ubuntu, CentOS, or Windows 2016 edition of DSVM to a non-GPUâ€“based Azure VM, in which case all of the deep learning frameworks will fall back to the CPU mode.
