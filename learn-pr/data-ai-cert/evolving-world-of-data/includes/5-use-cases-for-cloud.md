Azure can work for a range of industries, including the web, healthcare, and Internet of Things (IoT). Let's explore how Azure can make a difference in these industries.

## Web

As a data engineer, use the Azure Cosmos DB multimaster replication model to create a data architecture that supports web and mobile applications. Thanks to Microsoft performance commitments, these applications can achieve a response time of less than 10 ms anywhere in the world. By reducing the processing time of their websites, global organizations can increase customer satisfaction.

## Healthcare

In the healthcare industry, use Azure Databricks to accelerate big-data analytics and AI solutions. Apply these technologies to genome studies or pharmacy sales forecasting at a petabyte scale. Using Databricks features, you can set up your Spark environment in minutes and autoscale quickly and easily.

Using Azure, you can collaborate with data scientists on shared projects and workspaces in a wide range of languages, including SQL, R, Scala, and Python. Because of native integration with Azure Active Directory and other Azure services, you can build diverse solution types. For example, build a modern data warehouse or machine learning and real-time analytics solutions.

## IoT solutions

Over the last couple of years, hundreds of thousands of devices have been produced to generate sensor data. These are known as IoT devices. 

Using technologies like Azure IoT Hub, you can design a data solution architecture that captures information from IoT devices so that the information can be analyzed.
