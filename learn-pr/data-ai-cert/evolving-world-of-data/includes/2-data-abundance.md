Over the last 30 years, we've seen an exponential increase in the number of devices and software that generate data to meet current business and user needs.  Businesses store, interpret, manage, transform, process, aggregate, and report this data to interested parties. These parties include internal management, investors, business partners, regulators, and consumers.  

Data consumers view data on PCs, tablets, and mobile devices that are either connected or disconnected. Consumers both generate and use data. They do this in the workplace and during leisure time with social media applications. Business stakeholders use data to make business decisions. Consumers use data to make decisions such as what to buy, for example. Thanks to AI, Azure Machine Learning can now both consume data and make decisions the way humans do.

Data forms include text, stream, audio, video, and metadata. Data can be structured, unstructured, or aggregated. For structured databases, data architects define the structure (schema) as they create the data storage in platform technologies such as Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Data Warehouse.  For unstructured (NoSQL) databases, each data element can have its own schema at query time. Data can be stored as a file in Azure Blob storage or as NoSQL data in Azure Cosmos DB or Azure HDInsight.

Data engineers must maintain data systems that are accurate, highly secure, and constantly available. The systems must comply with applicable regulations such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and industry standards such as PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard). International companies might also have special data requirements that conform to regional norms such as the local language and date format. Data in these systems can be located anywhere. It can be on-premises or in the cloud, and it can be processed either in real time or in a batch.  

Azure provides a comprehensive and rich set of data technologies that can store, transform, process, analyze, and visualize a variety of data formats in a secure way.  As data formats evolve, Microsoft continually releases new technologies to the Azure platform.  Azure customers can explore these new technologies in preview mode.  Using the on-demand Azure subscription model, customers can minimize costs, paying only for what they consume and only when they need it.
