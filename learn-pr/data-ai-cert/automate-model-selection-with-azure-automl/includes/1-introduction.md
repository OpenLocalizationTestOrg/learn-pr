In this module, you will learn about the machine learning pipeline and how the Microsoft Azure Machine Learning service's automated machine learning (AutoML) capability can automate some laborious parts of machine learning. You will create Python code that uses the AutoML service to find the best model for your experiment. Then you will test the model by using Python code.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Learn how to streamline machine learning by using Azure Machine Learning pipelines.
- Automate model and hyperparameter selection by using Azure Machine Learning pipelines.
- Create a Python script that uses the Azure Machine Learning service's AutoML to recommend a model.
- Test the recommended model from your Python script.
