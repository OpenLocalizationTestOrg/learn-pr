  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which step below isn't part of using AutoML?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Configure the compute target to run the experiment."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is not correct. You must configure the compute target to use AutoML."
    - content: "Select the experiment type."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not correct. You need to tell AutoML the experiment type."
    - content: "Deploy the model."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is correct.  Deploying the model is separate from using AutoML."
  
  - content: "Which service below is not included as part of AutoML?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Data preparation"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct.  Data preparation should be done prior to using AutoML."
    - content: "Machine learning model recommendation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not correct.  AutoML supports automation evaluation of models and recommendation of the best one to use."
    - content: "Hyperparameter tuning"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That is correct.  AutoML supports automatics hyperparameter tuning which is covered in detail in another module."

  - content: "One of the AutoMLConfig settings is primary_metric.  Which of the following values is not a valid value for this setting?"
    choices: 
    - content: "bayesian_correlation"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That is correct.  bayesian_correlation isn't a valid value."
    - content: "normalized_root_mean_squared_error"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not correct.  normalized_root_mean_squared_error is a valid value."
    - content: "spearman_correlation"
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: "That's not correct.  spearman_correlation is a valid value."
