In this module, you will learn about the types of Azure Data Science Virtual Machines (DSVMs) and when to use each type. You will learn about the Windows-based and Linux-based DSVMs, which each support a different need. A special version of a Windows-based DSVM is the Geo AI image that supports geospatial AI with the commercial software ArcGIS Pro. If you need to do deep learning, you can use the Windows or Linux Ubuntu DSVM, which you can configure to use high-speed computational GPUs.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Learn how to create Windows-based and Linux-based DSVMs
