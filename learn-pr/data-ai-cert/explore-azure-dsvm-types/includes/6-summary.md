In this module, you learned about the types of Azure DSVMs and when to use each type. The two basic DSVM types are Windows-based DSVMs and Linux-based DSVMs. Each support different needs. A special version of a Windows-based DSVM is the Geo AI image that supports geospatial AI with the commercial software ArcGIS Pro. For deep learning, consider the Windows-based DSVM or Linux-based Ubuntu DSVM. A DSVM specifically configured for deep learning and high-speed computational GPUs is available on both Windows 2016 and Linux Ubuntu.
