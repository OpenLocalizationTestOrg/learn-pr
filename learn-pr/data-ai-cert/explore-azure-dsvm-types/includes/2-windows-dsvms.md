The tools installed on the Windows-based DSVM include the most popular data science software, frameworks, and tools to support integration of Azure services. You can use the Windows-based DSVM to jump-start your data science projects. 

There are no software charges for the DSVM image. You pay only the Azure usage fees, and those depend on the size of the virtual machine you provision.

## Features of the Windows Data Science Virtual Machine

The Windows-based DSVM includes some features that are not available on the Linux-based DSVM.

- Tutorials available for training purposes.
- Support for Microsoft Office.
- SQL Server integrated with Machine Learning Services to support Python/R execution with SQL Server.

In addition, the Windows-based DSVM includes several preinstalled programming languages, including R, Python, SQL, and C#. You can develop, test, and run your code with Microsoft Visual Studio, or Visual Studio Code. The DSVM also comes with several other development and data access tools:

- Azure SDK to integrate Microsoft Azure cloud services into your apps
- Power BI Desktop
- Azure PowerShell
- AzCopy
- Azure Data Lake Storage
- Migration tools for various databases (DocumentDB, Azure Cosmos DB, etc.)
- Data Management Gateway

## Data science tools

The Windows DSVM has many preconfigured data science tools for data visualization, model training, deployment, and more. Some of these tools are:

- Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python
- Anaconda Python distribution
- Jupyter Notebook with R, Python, and Apache Spark Python (PySpark) kernels
- Microsoft Visual Studio Community
- Microsoft Power BI Desktop
- Microsoft SQL Server + Microsoft Machine Learning Services
- Apache Spark instance for local development and testing
- Julia Pro by Julia Computing
- Python/R
- Git
