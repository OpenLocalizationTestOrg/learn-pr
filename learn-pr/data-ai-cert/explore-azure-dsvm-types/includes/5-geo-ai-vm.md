The Geo AI DSVM is a version of the Windows DSVM specially configured to support geospatial artificial intelligence and is offered through the collaboration between Esri and Microsoft. *Geospatial artificial intelligence* (Geo AI) refers to the incorporation of machine learning in mapping, map interpretation, or any machine learning with geographical content.

ArcGIS Pro is Esri's next-generation 64-bit desktop geographic information system (GIS). , ArcGIS Pro is technologically ahead of everything else on the market, and provides professional 2D and 3D mapping in an intuitive user interface. ArcGIS Pro is a big step forward in advancing visualization, analytics, image processing, data management, and integration.

The Geo AI DSVM augments the Windows DSVM with the rich geospatial capabilities of ArcGIS Pro. Both Python and R work with ArcGIS Pro, and are preconfigured on the Geo AI Data Science VM. This enable programmatic access to geospatial analytics within your AI applications. Sample Jupyter Notebooks are provided to help you start building AI applications infused with geospatial intelligence.

## Tools included

The Geo AI DSVM offers a large set of tools for machine learning, which are also offered in other DSVM versions.

Some of the Deep learning tools included in Geo AI DSVM are:

- Deep-learning frameworks such as: 
	- TensorFlow
	- Cognitive Toolkit
	- Torch
	- Chainer
- Keras
- Caffe2
- A standalone instance of Spark

>| [!IMPORTANT] 
> Tools need to be compatible with GPUs.

Some of the development tools for acquiring and preprocessing text and image data are:

- Microsoft R Server Developer Edition
- Anaconda Python
- Jupyter Notebooks (Python and R)
- Visual Studio Community Edition with Python and R tools
- SQL Server Developer Edition
- Julia Pro by Julia Computing
- PyCharm

## Examples of Geo AI

Examples of Geo AI include:

- Real-time results of traffic conditions
- Driver availability in Uber or Lyft at any time
- Deep learning for disaster response
- Urban growth prediction

Even more examples are available on the Geo AI DSVM.

## Summary

There are many ways to use this type of machine learning or deep learning. However, configuring and installing tools specific to Geo AI can be grueling. The Geo AI DSVM offers example experiments in the environment, abridges set-up by preinstalling and preconfiguring the required software, and verifies the compatibility of technologies.
