A key factor in AI applications is the ability to interact intelligently with the user. Some of the most common AI interactions occur through bots. You can build conversational intelligence into your bot by using Azure Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS).

LUIS is an Azure Cognitive Services API that applies custom machine-learning intelligence to a user's conversational natural-language text. LUIS uses certain aspects of the text to predict the user's overall meaning and pull out relevant detailed information. Your applications can use this information to interact with the user.
