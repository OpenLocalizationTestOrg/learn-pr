Data engineers who work on enterprise-level projects provide data to a variety of professionals, ranging from information workers to data scientists. Many organizations that pursue data-transformation projects still use traditional work roles such as business analysts. But as data types evolve and analytics methods change, new roles emerge.

Suppose your organization is planning a digital-transformation project where data plays a key role. The organization will incorporate the best of their current systems, such as the online transaction processing (OLTP) and data warehousing systems. But the organization also wants to use predictive analytics to take advantage of sales opportunities and improve operational expenditures.

As the database administrator for your company, your job is to move existing data into new systems and to connect them together. Where do you start? Is your job obsolete? The short answer is no. You have nothing to lose, because your skills are still essential. And you have everything to gain by learning new skills in technologies that unlock the potential of modern data engineering techniques.
