Azure SDKs help automate various redundant operations in Azure. In an enterprise scenario, you'll often need to upload files from on-premises or local servers to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 at regular intervals. Analytics applications can then use Azure Databricks and Azure HDInsight to derive insights from the uploaded data, even if the data is formatted differently.

Azure Storage stores various forms of data in a way that's scalable and reliable. Whether the data is structured or unstructured, Azure Storage can store all of it. 

Use Azure Storage Explorer to efficiently manage your data. This feature-rich application offers various tools for various storage types. Download it on your machine and connect to your subscription to access your storage account without using the Azure portal. Using Storage Explorer, you can also connect to other Azure data storage services, such as  Azure Cosmos DB.
