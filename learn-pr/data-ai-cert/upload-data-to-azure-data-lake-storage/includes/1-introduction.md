Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 is an enterprise data lake solution designed to run large-scale analytical workloads in the cloud. It takes core capabilities from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1, including security, scale, and file system semantics. It combines these capabilities with the low cost and high availability of Azure Blob storage.

Let's suppose you want to show the company Contoso the various ways you can upload data into Data Lake Storage Gen2. Your demonstration will include examples of how to load data in an ad-hoc way and how to integrate the upload capability into applications. You'll also show how to use Azure Data Factory to copy data into Data Lake Storage Gen2.

## Learning objectives

In this module you will:

- Create a Data Lake Storage Gen2 store.
- Upload data to the Data Lake Storage Gen2 store by using Azure Storage Explorer.
- Demonstrate code that uploads data in .NET.
- Copy data from a Data Lake Storage Gen1 store to a Data Lake Storage Gen2 store.
