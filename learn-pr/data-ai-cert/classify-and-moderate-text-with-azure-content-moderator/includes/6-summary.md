As you've seen in this module, it's easy to add text filters to your apps and services with Microsoft Azure Content Moderator. With the Text Moderation API, you can:

- Analyze text to look for unwanted content.
- Classify the potentially offensive content.
- Get insights into the potential PII that's being shared so that you can protect it.

## Cleanup

To avoid any unexpected costs in your Azure account, delete the **LearnRG** resource group. Deleting this group will remove all the resources we created in this module. Here are the steps you need to take:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true).
1. In the left pane, select **Resource groups**, and find the **LearnRG** resource group.
1. Select the resource group, and either right-click the row or use the **ellipsis** (...) button to open the context menu.
1. Select **Delete resource group**.
1. Enter the name of the **LearnRG** resource group, and then select **Delete**. Azure will remove all the resources for you.
