In this module, we discussed each of the products available for Machine Learning on Azure. The key takeaway is to understand how to differentiate each of them, because you can utilize every product in different ways.

Although many of these products provide similar tools, their functionalities vary. For example, some of them are meant to be learning tools, while others are more for professional use. Our hope is that now you can identify which tools are best for your needs, and what the tools can do for you in your Machine Learning practice. In the following module, we briefly discuss what has been covered in this course to verify your understanding of the topics explained.
