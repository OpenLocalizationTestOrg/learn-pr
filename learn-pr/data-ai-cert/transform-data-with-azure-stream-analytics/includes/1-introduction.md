In Azure Stream Analytics, jobs are the foundation of real-time analytics. The good news is that setting up jobs is straightforward: 

- Set the job inputs to ingest data. 
- Define how to process the data.
- Set up a job output to store or display the results.

Let's say that you're demonstrating to the Contoso team how to set up Stream Analytics. You first provide a high-level workflow. Then you show how to create a job input and a job output. Finally, you provide example queries for the analytics. You show the team how to start the job and verify the result.
