Now that you've created a QnA knowledge base, it's time to publish it so you can access it from a client application.

1. On the QnA Maker Knowledge base page, where you were testing in the previous exercise, select **PUBLISH** in the menu at the top of the page.
1. Read the message on the next page. It indicates that your KB will move from test to production.  It also points out that your KB will be available as an endpoint that you can use in apps and bots.
1. Select **Publish**.
1. After a short time, a success message will appear (if no errors occur).
1. Note the URL information that appears. You can use the information provided to test the KB with Postman or curl.

If you need to, you can select **Edit Service** to go back to the KB and make edits.
