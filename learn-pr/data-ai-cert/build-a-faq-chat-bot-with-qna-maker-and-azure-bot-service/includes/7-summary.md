You've achieved quite a bit in this module. QnA Maker is an easy way to provide answers to common questions by using existing documents or FAQ lists. Integrating the QnA Maker service with a chatbot can make it easier for users interact with FAQ lists in a conversational way, so they don't have to search through long documents in a browser.
