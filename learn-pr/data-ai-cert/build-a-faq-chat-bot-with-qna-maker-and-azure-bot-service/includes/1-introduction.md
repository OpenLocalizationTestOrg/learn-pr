A bot is an autonomous program that interacts with people or computer systems in a predictable way. The logic behind a bot is designed and programmed by the bot creator, often with the help of tools like the Microsoft Bot Framework. Microsoft also has other AI services, included in Azure Cognitive Services, that can enhance the capabilities of your bots.

QnA Maker is one of the AI services that can help a bot answer your users' natural language questions by matching them with the best possible answers from your knowledge base.
