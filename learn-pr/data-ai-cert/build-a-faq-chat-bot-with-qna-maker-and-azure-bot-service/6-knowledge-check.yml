    choices:
    - content: "It stores the questions that users type into the chat window."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The knowledge base doesn't have the ability to collect and store user questions from a chat window."
    - content: "It's a set of question and answer (QnA) pairs and optional metadata."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A QnA Maker knowledge base consists of a set of question and answer (QnA) pairs and optional metadata that's associated with each QnA pair."
    - content: "It's a storage blob containing documents that make up the supported questions and answers."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Though the knowledge base can be built from a set of documents, you don't need to create a storage account or blob storage to hold the documents."

    choices:
    - content: "By passing an access token as the first field in a JSON request to the service."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The QnA service doesn't look for an access token in a JSON request."
    - content: "By setting the Content-Type in the HTTP request to the application or bot."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Content-Type field contains application JSON. It's not used for authorization."
    - content: "By using the knowledge base ID, host endpoint, and endpoint key values from the QnA service."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You need to enter these values in the corresponding fields in the Application Settings for the bot."
