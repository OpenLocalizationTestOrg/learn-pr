Machine Learning Studio is a collaborative drag-and-drop tool you can use to build, test, and deploy predictive analytics solutions that use your data. Machine Learning Studio publishes models as web services that can easily be consumed by custom apps or BI tools such as Excel.

Machine Learning Studio is where data science, predictive analytics, cloud resources, and your data meet.

Now that you've created your Machine Learning Studio Workspace and account, you're ready to create your own custom experiments and publish them as web services.
