In this lesson, we learned about some of the security controls that Azure SQL Data Warehouse offers to secure your data warehouse infrastructure and the data that's stored in it. Specifically, we walked through how to enable security by using firewall rules, authentication, and authorization. We also looked at how to protect the data in the data warehouse by using transparent encryption. Finally, we looked at how to enable security monitoring for your data warehouse and how to enable an audit trail of database activity.
