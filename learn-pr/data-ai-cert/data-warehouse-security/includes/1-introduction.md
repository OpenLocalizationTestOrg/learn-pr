Data warehouse security involves hardening the data warehouse and its related assets to help protect privacy, integrity, and availability.

You have set up an Azure SQL Data Warehouse instance for Contoso. The company now requires you to secure access to the server and control access to the database data. You'll set up the authentication mechanism at the server level and provide further security by configuring the server firewall. When you've finished that, you'll control which Contoso employees can access the server by creating logins.

You'll then provide more granular access at the database level by creating a database user and controlling the level of access to data by using column-level and row-level security.
