  - content: "You have an Azure SQL Data Warehouse database. Within the database, you have a dimension table named Stores that contains store information. You have a total of 263 stores nationwide. Store information is retrieved in more than half of the queries that are issued against this database. These queries include staff information per store, sales information per store, and finance information. You want to improve the query performance of these queries by configuring the table geometry of the Stores table. Which is the appropriate table geometry to select for the Stores table?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Round-robin"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Round-robin distribution is a table geometry that is useful for initial data loads."
    - content: "Non-clustered"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Non-clustered is not a valid table geometry in Azure SQL Data Warehouse."
    - content: "Replicated table"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A replicated table is an appropriate table geometry choice because the size of the data in the table is less than 200 MB. The table will be replicated to every distribution node of a data warehouse in Azure SQL Data Warehouse to improve performance."
