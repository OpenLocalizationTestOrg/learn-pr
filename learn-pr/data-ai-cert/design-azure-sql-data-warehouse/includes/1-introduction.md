A data warehouse is a centralized relational database that integrates data from one or more sources. Data warehouses store current and historical data and are used for reporting and analysis of data.

Many organizations need to store and process data more quickly and at an increasing scale to meet business demand and respond to market shifts. Azure SQL Data Warehouse is a cloud-based data warehousing technology that can store and analyze petabyte-scale data (that's a million gigabytes)!

Assume you are a data engineer for Contoso. Your on-premises business intelligence solution consistently finishes running around 11:00 AM every morning. The company's database administrator has tried everything to improve performance, including scaling up and tuning the servers as far as they can go. Improvements have been minimal. Report generation finishes no earlier than 10:00 AM.

As a data engineer, you have been tasked with determining how SQL Data Warehouse can improve the situation. Then, your role is to help the database administrator set up SQL Data Warehouse for your company.
