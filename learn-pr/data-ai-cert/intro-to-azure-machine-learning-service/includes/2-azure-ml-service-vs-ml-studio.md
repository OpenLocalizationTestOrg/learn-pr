Because the names are similar, it's important to distinguish between Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio and the Azure Machine Learning service. Both of these products can be used to develop and deploy machine learning models, but they support different needs. 

**Azure Machine Learning Studio** is a drag-and-drop visual workspace that is user-friendly and doesn't require any programming. It's ideal for learning data science and for small machine learning projects.

**Azure Machine Learning service** provides callable services to scale, monitor, and deploy machine learning models. It's meant to augment and extend the data science pipeline with integrated Azure services. The Azure Machine Learning service SDK lets you write code that uses these prebuilt services and integrate them into your data science workflow. 

You start your model development on your local computer with the Python tools and open-source frameworks of your choice. Then use the Azure Machine Learning service via Python modules to speed up model training and evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment, complete with a callable REST API.
