  questions:

  - content: "Mike is the data engineer for Contoso and has a data warehouse created with a database named Crystal. Within the database is a table named DimSuppliers. The suppliers' information is stored in a single text file named Suppliers.txt and is 1,200 MB in size. It's currently stored in a container with an Azure blob store. Your Azure SQL Data Warehouse is configured as Gen 2 DW30000c. How can Mike maximize the performance of the data load?"
    choices: 
    - content: "Increase the Gen 2 DWU units."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not the correct answer. Gen 2 DW30000c is the highest limit and can't be scaled beyond this size."
    - content: "Split the text file into 60 files of 20 MB each."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's the correct answer. Separating the single text file of Suppliers.txt into 60 files can take advantage of the fact that Gen 2 DW30000c uses 60 compute nodes and the parallelism of the data load can be evenly spread for quicker performance."
    - content: "Use Gen 1 DW6000."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not the correct answer. Gen 1 compute nodes have less power than Gen 2 compute nodes and won't improve the performance."

  - content: "Mike is the data engineer for Contoso and has a data warehouse created with a database named Crystal. Mike created a master key, followed by a database-scoped credential. What should he create next?"
    choices: 
    - content: "An external table."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not the correct answer. Mike must have an external data source before he creates an external table."
    - content: "An external data source."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's the correct answer. After the master key and the database-scoped credential are created, Mike should create an external data source that contains a URL to the blob location and the name of the database-scoped credential."
    - content: "A physical table."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not the correct answer. Mike must have an external data source and an external table before he can create a physical table."
