Training a machine learning model can be as easy as loading data and running one line of code using packages like scikit-learn, but most of the time the training process requires more work - particularly around understanding the dataset being processed so you can determine the best model to apply.

In this module, you will use the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset (MNIST dataset) as an example to explore the Azure Machine Learning service. You can build and train your model both locally or via remote containers. You will train a simple logistic regression model and a series of k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) models to find the one with the highest accuracy. The example is an image classification problem in which you want to determine the number that is contained in an image.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Create a simple logistic model to recognize numbers in images from the MNIST dataset
- Create a series of kNN models to find the one with the highest accuracy
- Create an Azure Machine Learning experiment
- Train a model by using the Azure Machine Learning service
- Submit the model, monitor the run, and retrieve the results
