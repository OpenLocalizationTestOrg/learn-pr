Congratulations! You've built a simple predictive analysis model using Azure Machine Learning Studio. Let's recap what you accomplished. You used an imported dataset ("ingest data") to create an experiment. Then you defined the logic in the visual designer and trained the model. Finally, you tested and published the experiment as a web service. This was a simple example, but the steps you went through are common to any AI solution you build.

Developing a model like this is an iterative process. As you modify the various functions and their parameters, your results converge until you are satisfied that you have a trained, effective model. You can then link this model to other advanced AI services in Azure, or use this solution as part of a bigger application structure to meet the business needs.
