The Speech Translation API transcribes audio streams into text. Your application can display this text to the user or act upon it as command input. You can use this API either with an SDK client library (for supported platforms and languages) or a representational state transfer (REST) API. 

With the Speech Translation API, you can:

- Extend the reach of your applications across mobile, desktop, and web.
- Easily translate to and from 10 languages through the open REST interface of the Speech Translation API. This API is a cloud-based automatic speech-translation service (also known as machine translation).
