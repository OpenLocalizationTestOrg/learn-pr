In this module, you walked through the Razor Pages related architecture of a basic ASP.NET Core application UI client. This application provided a UI for updating and deleting product listings exposed through a web API endpoint. You created a new Razor Page form, taking advantage of Razor Tag Helpers. With Razor Tag Helpers, you quickly added client-side and server-side validation. You also gained cross-site antiforgery validation. You coded its `PageModel` class file that provided a separation of concern for the page's logic operations and data properties. You walked through the code of the HTTP client you injected into your Razor PageModel class. You injected the HTTP client as a service by using ASP.NET Core's supported Dependency Injection pattern.
