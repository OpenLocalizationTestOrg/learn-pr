An online dog toy retailer, named Contoso Pets, needs a data access project. You're asked to develop such a project for their web storefront. The project has to support adding, reading, modifying, and removing customer orders in a relational database.

This module explores creating a data access project using .NET Standard and C#. An Azure SQL database will be used to store the orders. Entity Framework (EF) Core will be used as the **O**bject-**R**elational **M**apper (O/RM)&mdash;a tool enabling .NET developers to work with a database using .NET objects. EF Core will be used for executing **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, **D**elete (CRUD) operations on the orders.
