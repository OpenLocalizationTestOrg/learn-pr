    Irwin is the product manager. He's been in the video game industry for decades. Irwin acts friendly towards the development teams, but everyone knows he favors a tight schedule over people. Irwin has a relatively fixed mindset, but if there's anything that can help teams get games to market faster with less effort, he's all ears.
