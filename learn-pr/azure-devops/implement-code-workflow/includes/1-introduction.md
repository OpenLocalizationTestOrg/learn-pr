This module is about building code collaboration by using Git and GitHub.

Elite performers deploy code more frequently and experience much faster lead times than other performers. To become elite performers, developers need a way to work with source code and share their changes with others. Collaboration is a key DevOps value, and a source control system that fosters cooperation is a great DevOps tool.

Although Azure DevOps works with various kinds of source control, many developers choose Git because it's a distributed system that enables all contributors to have their own copy of the work. In this module, you use Git's branching and merging capabilities to more efficiently work with other developers. You also use GitHub, because it provides a central location for teams to host their projects and share their work.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

* Collaborate with others by choosing an appropriate branching and merging strategy.
* Add a badge to your GitHub repository to show the status of the latest build.
* Add a dashboard widget to visualize your build history.
* Set up a rule on your GitHub repository to require a reviewer.

## Prerequisites

The prerequisites are the same as those in the [Create a build pipeline with Azure Pipelines](/learn/modules/create-a-build-pipeline?azure-portal=true) module.

Make sure that your _Space Game_ project is loaded in Visual Studio Code and available on GitHub.

## Meet the team

You met the _Space Game_ web team at Tailspin Toys in previous modules. As a refresher, here's who you'll work with in this module.
