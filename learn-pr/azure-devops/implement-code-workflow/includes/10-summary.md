In this module, you learned how to collaborate with others by using Git and GitHub.

Andy and Mara are well on their way to implementing a system that will allow them to better collaborate as a team and help ensure that only quality code is merged to the `master` branch.

A build badge and dashboard widgets help the team and others understand the state of the latest build and track the build history over time.

Although Andy and Mara are the primary code contributors, setting up a rule on GitHub to require a review is a good way to enforce a disciplined code review practice. Even minor errors can cause a build to break. As an example, you watched a typing error make its way through the build and into the hands of the QA team.

### Try GitHub Desktop

In this module, you made basic changes to the _Space Game_ website. In practice, your changes will likely be much more complex. Although you can do everything you need from the command line, [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com?azure-portal=true) is a great way to visually compare and commit your changes.

### Learn more about Git

Although you can learn Git with just a few commands, full mastery will enable you to perform more complex kinds of merges and understand the history of your code base.

[git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com?azure-portal=true) and the book [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2?azure-portal=true) are two excellent resources for learning more about Git.
