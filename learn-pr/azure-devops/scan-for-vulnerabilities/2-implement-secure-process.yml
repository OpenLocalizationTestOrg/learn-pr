  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "How can you make sure your code isn't exploitable?"
    choices:
    - content: "Make every code construct private."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is not always possible, since many code constructs need to be accessible from other code. Plus, this won't protect against other types of vulnerabilities."
    - content: "Never run SQL queries."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although you'll want to guard against exploits such as SQL injection attacks, this alone won't protect against other types of vulnerabilities."
    - content: "Scan your code regularly for known vulnerabilities."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "By shifting left, you can identify potential vulnerabilities early in the process."
  - content: "What is the OWASP Top Ten?"
    choices:
    - content: "The top critical security risks to web applications."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The OWASP Top Ten lists the top critical security risks to web applications as identified by the world's leading security experts."
    - content: "The top critical security risks for Ruby applications."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The OWASP Top Ten isn't limited to Ruby applications."
    - content: "The top critical security risks to all types of applications."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The OWASP Top Ten focuses on critical security risks specifically to web applications."
  - content: "Which of these is an example of a CVE?"
    choices:
    - content: "Buffer overruns in a specific piece of web server software."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The CVE focuses on specific instances in software that's generally available."
    - content: "Access of an uninitialized pointer."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You would likely find this in the CWE, which defines security vulnerabilities in the general sense."
    - content: "A severity score of 9.0."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is likely an example of a CVSS score, which gives you a sense of how severe a vulnerability is."
