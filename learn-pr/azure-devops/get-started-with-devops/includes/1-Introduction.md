Azure DevOps can help your team release code in a more efficient, cooperative, and stable manner. Let's rejoin the team as they learn about DevOps. Together, we'll discover what it takes to get an Azure DevOps practice started.

In the [previous module](/learn/modules/assess-your-development-process?azure-portal=true), you met the team at Tailspin Toys. They're working on a new game but they've got many problems with their release process. These problems are affecting the quality of the products they deliver to their customers. The team knows they need to change but they don't know how.

The newest team member, Mara, believes DevOps will help. Her goal is to convince her teammates. She'll explain more about the value stream mapping (VSM) exercise she started in the previous module. Hopefully, her explanation will show the team why DevOps is the way forward.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Learn what DevOps is and identify what separates elite performers from low performers
- Identify what services Azure DevOps provides
- Set up an account in Azure DevOps

## Prerequisites

The modules in this learning path form a progression. We recommend you start at the beginning of the [Evolve your DevOps practices](/learn/paths/evolve-your-devops-practices?azure-portal=true) learning path before you start this module.

## Meet the team

You met the _Space Game_ web team at Tailspin Toys in the previous module. As a refresher, here's who you'll work with in this module.
