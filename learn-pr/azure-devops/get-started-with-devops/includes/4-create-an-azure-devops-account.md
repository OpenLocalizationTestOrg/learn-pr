Microsoft provides free Azure DevOps accounts for individuals, small teams, and open-source projects. Enterprises can also sign up for Azure DevOps accounts that can scale to thousands of team members. We're going to sign up for a free Azure DevOps organization to see how its services can help us on our DevOps journey.

> [!NOTE]
> In this learning path, you'll use Azure DevOps Services, which Microsoft hosts for you. There's also [Azure DevOps Server](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/server?azure-portal=true), the on-premises version of Azure DevOps Services that you can install and run on your own network.

## Create an Azure DevOps organization

Follow along with the team by setting up your own free Azure DevOps organization:

1. Go to [dev.azure.com](https://dev.azure.com?azure-portal=true).
1. Select the **Start free** button.
1. Sign in by using your **Microsoft account**. Or if you don't have a Microsoft account, select **Create One!** and complete the steps.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You may have a Microsoft account already. Typically these end with hotmail.com or outlook.com.
1. Review the Terms of Service, Privacy Statement, and Code of Conduct, and select **Continue** if you agree to them.

    > [!NOTE]
    > As the person creating the Azure DevOps organization, you will automatically become the owner. Please be considerate when deciding on your account name and avoid existing legal entities.

## Create an organization

Next, set up an organization called Tailspin. Here's how:

1. If you've never created an Azure DevOps organization, you'll see a window with a **Create new organization** button in the right pane. If you have, you'll see **+ New organization** at the bottom left. Select the button you see.
1. In the Azure DevOps Terms of Service and Privacy notification window, select **Continue**.
1. Create an organization named **Tailspin** next to the **`dev.azure.com/`** field. If you're prompted that the name is already taken, just add some numbers to the end to make it unique. For example, Tailspin0523.
1. Choose a location near you where your projects will be hosted.
1. Select **Continue**.

The next screen prompts you to create a project. You'll do that in the next module.

Congratulations! In the next module, the team will use Azure Boards to create its first project and backlog.
