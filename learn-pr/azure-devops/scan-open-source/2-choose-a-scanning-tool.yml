  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "How can you make sure an open-source component you use doesn't have security defects?"
    choices:
    - content: "Examine the component's documentation to understand known vulnerabilities."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "It's not good practice to rely on the authors of an open-source project to report vulnerabilities."
    - content: "Regularly scan open-source components that you use for known vulnerabilities."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "By shifting left, you can identify potential vulnerabilities early in the process."
    - content: "Use open-source code only from reputable authors."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Even the most reputable authors can inadvertently publish vulnerable code."
  - content: "Why is it important to assess the license that's associated with every open-source component you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Some licenses have provisions that might not be acceptable to your company's use of open source."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "As an example, some licenses require you to make public any changes you make to an open-source library. Doing so might reveal trade secrets that you want to protect."
    - content: "It helps you choose a license for your own open source projects."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although you can learn  how other projects define their license terms, the focus here is on ensuring that the licenses you use are acceptable to your company's use of open source."
    - content: "It's not important. Open source refers to free, unrestricted use of the software."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Most open-source components come with licensing terms. Always understand the terms you're agreeing to."
