    choices:
    - content: "Reusable code that other developers can use in their own projects."

    - content: "A Git construct for moving a repository."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A package is not something specific to Git."
    - content: "A preview version of your library."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Packages relate to both pre-release and stable versions of your library."
  - content: "Say you've built a package that you want to share publicly. What's the easiest way to do that?"
    choices:
    - content: "A public hosting service, such as NuGet."
      isCorrect: true

    - content: "On a public network file share."

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Others won't be able to access packages behind your firewall."
  - content: "What is Azure Artifacts?"
    choices:
    - content: "A place to upload your applications."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Azure Artifacts enables you to create and share packages, not complete applications."
    - content: "A place to share package feeds for Maven, npm, NuGet, and Python libraries."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "You can configure your feeds to allow public access or access only from select users."
    - content: "A place to archive old code that is no longer in use."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While you could maintain old versions of your package on Azure Artifacts, Azure Artifacts is not an archive system."
