Agile is a process for planning the work that a team will do. It's based on iterative development and helps a team better plan for and react to the inevitable changes that occur in software development. Let's listen in on Mara's discussion with Andy after the latest release.

Mara felt she'd made a few small steps toward interesting the team in DevOps, but progress has stalled. The team has been too busy fixing bugs in the last release to think about anything else.

Recall that Irwin, the product manager, provided the team with some rather critical customer feedback about the racing game website. Resolving these issues wasn't fun. Andy and Mara would write code and then hand it to Amita, the tester. Amita always seemed to find new bugs and had to hand the code back. The build server failed. Tim couldn't get the game's website to work in production, even after it worked in dev and test. Everyone worked long hours and lost a couple weekends.

After they shipped the release, Mara and Andy sat down for coffee. They were both tired. Mara was discouraged but Andy had a different attitude.

**Andy**: I don't know why you're surprised. Getting software out the door is hard. It's always a slog. Have you ever done it differently?

**Mara**: I have and I think we could make things easier here, too. I really believe DevOps can help us.

**Andy**: I remember we did a value-stream mapping exercise, but now what? We've got to get started on the new release. I thought we were done with DevOps.

**Mara**: There's a lot more we can do. I think we should take the first step and do some Agile planning. We can use Azure Boards to help us.

**Andy**: What do you mean by Agile?

**Mara**: Agile is an approach to software development. The term "Agile" was coined in 2001 in the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org?azure-portal=true). The manifesto established some guiding principles for a better approach to software development. The manifesto says:

> We value:
>
> * Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
> * Working software over comprehensive documentation
> * Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
> * Responding to change over following a plan

 **Andy**: Look, if you know some magic way to make life easier, I'm all for it. My kids are always asleep by the time I get home. But this sounds very touchy-feely without any concrete solutions.

 **Mara**: It's not magic, but we can do it bit by bit, and Azure DevOps gives us the tools we need to implement Agile practices. For now, when we want to plan, we can use Azure Boards. First, can you explain the build process to me and help me identify the big problems?

 After lots of coffee, Mara and Andy identify the biggest problems in the build process. All the issues came up during the last release. After Andy leaves, Mara looks at her scribbled notes and decides to do a little Agile planning herself. On her own, she uses the Basic process on Azure Boards to get all the problems in one place.

Her next step is to show the board to the team and get them involved.
