In this module, the Tailspin team took their first steps towards adopting DevOps practices. You worked with them and learned how to use Azure Boards to get started with Agile work planning. A board gives you an easy way to see what's going on with a project and to manage your work. Some of the things you learned to do with Azure Boards include how to:

* Create projects
* Create work items
* Assign work items to team members
* Associate work items with a sprint, or iteration

## Learning path summary

Congratulations. You've completed the final module in the _Evolve your DevOps practices_ learning path. In this learning path, you:

* Saw how a value stream map can help you examine your existing processes and technologies.
* Saw what DevOps is (and isnâ€™t) and created an Azure DevOps organization.
* Learned how Azure Boards helps teams plan the work that needs to be done. You used the Basic process to set up a basic backlog of tasks you'll work on in upcoming modules.

## Continue the journey

You've seen the team identify their top-priority problems, but how will they solve them? If you want to work along with them and learn how to configure build pipelines that continuously build, test, and verify your applications, go to [Build applications with Azure DevOps](/learn/paths/build-applications-with-azure-devops?azure-portal=true).
