title: Run SQL Server 2017 on Linux containers
summary: |
 Containers provide isolated virtual environments in which you can run applications such as SQL Server 2017 
 and are growing in popularity because of their scalability. If you choose SQL Server 2017 to host your 
 databases, you can run that system in one or more containers based on either Linux or Windows and the 
 Docker system. You can create a container from an image that has SQL Server pre-installed or create your 
 own customized image. In this module, you will see how to run SQL Server 2017 in Linux containers and 
 host a custom database application.
