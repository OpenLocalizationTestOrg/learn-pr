  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "You want to create a new container image based on the SQL Server on Linux image. Which directive should you use in the Dockerfile to specify this parent?"
    choices:
    - content: "The COPY directive"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The COPY directive copies a file into the image. To specify the parent image, use the FROM directive."
    - content: "The FROM directive"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "The FROM directive is used to specify the parent image in the Dockerfile."
    - content: "The ENV directive"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The ENV directive sets an environment variable for the new image. To specify the parent image, use the FROM directive."
  - content: "You include this line in a Dockerfile: '#CMD [/opt/mssql/bin/sqlservr]'. When you build the image, SQL Server is not run. What must you do to fix the problem?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use #RUN instead of #CMD."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "CMD is the correct directive, but the '#' makes the line a comment and Docker ignores it."
    - content: "Use CMD instead of #CMD."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "CMD is the correct directive, but the '#' makes the line a comment and Docker ignores it."
    - content: "Use #ENV instead of #CMD."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "CMD is the correct directive, but the '#' makes the line a comment and Docker ignores it."
