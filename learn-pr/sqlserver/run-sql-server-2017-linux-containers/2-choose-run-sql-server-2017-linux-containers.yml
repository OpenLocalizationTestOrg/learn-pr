  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "You want to run a Windows server and a Linux server as cheaply as possible. Which of the following configurations should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use a Windows Server container and a Linux container running on a single Docker host."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This configuration is impossible. Windows containers can only run on Windows Docker hosts and Linux containers can only run on Linux Docker hosts. It is not possible to host containers with different operating systems on a single Docker host."
    - content: "Use a Windows Server VM and a Linux VM running on a single Hyper-V host."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This configuration is possible and uses less hardware than using separate servers so it is the cheapest possible option."
    - content: "Use a Windows Server container and a Linux container running on two separate Docker hosts."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This configuration uses two hardware servers so it is more expensive that using two VMs on a single Hyper-V host."
  - content: "You want to host a database for a website. The database will run on SQL Server 2017 and Ubuntu Linux. When you expect demand to increase, it is vital that you can increase capacity as fast as possible. Which architecture should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Deploy Linux on containers hosted by a Windows Docker server."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This configuration is impossible. Linux containers can only run on a Linux Docker host, not on a Windows Docker host."
    - content: "Deploy Linux on VMs hosted by a Windows Hyper-V server."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This configuration is possible but it takes longer to deploy extra VMs because they are larger than containers."
    - content: "Deploy Linux on containers hosted by a Linux Docker server."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This configuration is possible and you can deploy extra containers rapidly because a container image is small."
