The **Microsoft Database Experimentation Assistant (DEA)** is a tool that runs on your machine. DEA will run a trace capture against any workload on your existing database. DEA is then run against an upgraded database version to test its performance. Enabling you to prove the benefits of the upgrade.

Suppose you work at a telecommunications company, providing database support to the customer call center. For the last three years running, the company has won a number of industry and consumer awards for its high standard of customer service. However, the call center software is using a version of SQL Server that is soon to be unsupported and the underlying hardware needs upgrading.

Upgrading the call center database to SQL Server 2017 without impacting performance is key because the company is keen to maintain its award-winning standards. You want to test the current workload on an upgraded database, to reassure the stakeholders within the company that the call center software will remain responsive after the upgrade.

Here, you'll see how the DEA can compare a typical workload between existing and upgraded version of a database.
