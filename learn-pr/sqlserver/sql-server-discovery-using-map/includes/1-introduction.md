The **Microsoft Assessment and Planning (MAP)** toolkit is an agentless inventory, assessment, and reporting tool that will analyze your IT environment, and return a report with information that can be exported to Excel.

Suppose you have been hired as database administrator for an international company that has SQL Server instances located across the globe. The outgoing DBA has provided you with a list of server names and logins in a spreadsheet. You don't have detailed or up-to-date information about these servers. You know you should take an inventory of the version, edition, services packs, installed components, and underlying hardware for each SQL Server instance.

You begin by connecting to each server, but find this manual process is taking too long and you're repeating the same tasks each time. You also realize you'll need to repeat this exercise on a regular basis. Repeating inventorying will ensure you have up-to-date information in line with the hardware upgrades undertaken by the operations teams, and changes you apply to SQL Server.

You want to automate this process, because some of the SQL Servers you have already discovered need to be upgraded, and the process needs repeating to maintain a current inventory.

In this module, you'll see how to use the Microsoft Assessment and Planning toolkit to audit your database landscape, and repeat this process in future.
