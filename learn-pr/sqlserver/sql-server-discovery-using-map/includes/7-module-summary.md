In this module, you have seen how the Microsoft Assessment and Planning Toolkit (MAP) can be used to automatically scan the servers in your organization, and to list the number of SQL Server instances, with their versions and editions. You have also see how MAP lists the components installed on each instance, along with the operating systems, processors, and cores.

You learned how to use the MAP assessment reports to filter your results, and to find servers with the oldest SQL Server versions, and highest number of databases. You also used the reports to filter databases by size, and enabled options.

You saw how the toolkit can be used as the first step in upgrading your databases, but learned that it has many other uses because of the range and variety of data it can gather on the services running in your organization. As well as SQL Server, other infrastructure such as Exchange, Office 365, and Lync/Skype for Business servers can also be audited, far extending the use of this tool.

The Microsoft Assessment and Planning Toolkit collects inventory information in a methodical and reliable way, and is highly beneficial to organizations running more than a handful of servers. For a database administrator to log in to a dozen or more machines to gather the same data that can be collected in the Microsoft Assessment and Planning Toolkit, and maintain this on an on-going basis, would be too time-consuming and run the risk of generating inconsistent information.
