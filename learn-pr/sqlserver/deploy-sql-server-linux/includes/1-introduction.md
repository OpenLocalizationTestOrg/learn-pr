SQL Server has been one of the most popular and highest performing database systems for some time. Linux is a popular server operating system but, until now, it has not been possible to run SQL Server directly on a Linux Server. With SQL Server 2017, you can now deploy SQL Server onto a Linux Server.

Suppose, you're a database administrator at Wide World Importers, a wholesale company. Wide World Importers exclusively uses Linux on its servers and Linux VMs in the cloud, but you've decided that you can benefit from the functionality of SQL Server. 

You have a range of Linux distributions as well as Docker containers and want to learn how to deploy to these systems.

Here, you will learn how to deploy SQL Server to Linux and to Docker.
