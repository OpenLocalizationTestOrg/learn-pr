The **Microsoft Data Migration Assistant (DMA)** is a tool that compares a database's current version to a target version, and highlights any compatibility issues between these versions. DMA also advises you of new features in the target version that can be used to improve the performance of your database. Finally, DMA can upgrade your database.

Suppose you work at a law firm that has satellite offices in a number of major cities. Each office has previously taken responsibility for managing their own IT systems. The firm now wants to control the systems from head office, because inconsistencies between application versions are causing variations in case work.

You've been asked to upgrade the databases, and need to ensure the databases will be compatible with SQL Server 2017. First you manually inspecting stored procedures and configuration settings in each of the databases. Doing these steps manually takes a long time and is repetitive. After testing compatibility, you realize that you'll need a standard path for upgrading the databases. You'll also need to reassure the business that the databases will be of equal or improved performance after the upgrade.

In this module, you'll see how the Data Migration Assistant finds compatibility and performance issues in your databases before upgrading.
