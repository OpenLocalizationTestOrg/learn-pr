In this module, you learned how to use the Microsoft Data Migration Assistant to check for compatibility issues in your databases prior to upgrading. You discovered that you could use DMA to check for problems without having to install a new instance, or configure Azure. You saw how the assistant provides detailed steps for fixing issues and deprecated features, enabling you to bring your migrated database online without broken code.

You learned how to discover new features on the target server that would increase the performance of your source databases, increase security, and reduce storage costs. The assistant provides a concise list of new features you can implement to gain the immediate return on the investment of upgrading to a newer version of SQL Server.

The Data Migration Assistant can check your databases against SQL Azure Database, and SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines, and you learned how to assess the impact of migrating to the cloud without requiring any initial server set-up or additional cost.

You saw how the assistant upgrades your databases to a target version, and includes all the necessary logins, enabling users to connect and resume as seamlessly as possible after an upgrade. After migrating your databases with the Data Migration Assistant, you learned that you can export the results to a CSV or JSON file to develop custom reports.
