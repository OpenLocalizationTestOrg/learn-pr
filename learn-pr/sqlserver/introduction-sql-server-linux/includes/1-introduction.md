Microsoft SQL Server has many features that are unique, as compared to other database management systems:

- **Performance**. As SQL Server is currently first in the TPC-E benchmark for performance, and first for performance in the TPC-H 1 TB, 10 TB, and 30-TB benchmarks.
- **Flexibility**. SQL Server developers and administrators can choose their platform and language, with support for Transact-SQL, Java, C/C++, C#/VB.NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, and Ruby.
- **Security**. According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), SQL Server has been the most secure database over the last seven years.
- **Intelligence**. SQL Server is the only commercial Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) with Artificial Intelligence (AI) built-in. It supports R, Python, and Java running next to the data in-memory and at massive scale. SQL Server is also intelligent in adapting to your workloads, optimizing queries automatically for better performance.
- **Scalability**. SQL Server can run in-memory across all workloads, and can run on-premise, in the cloud, or in a hybrid architecture.
- **Business Intelligence (BI)**. SQL Server provides an end-to-end solution for reporting, and scales from mobile to desktop at a fraction of the cost of other systems.  

For these reasons, Wide World Importers are interested in running SQL Server 2017 on Linux. They understand that not all the SQL Server capabilities are available on Linux yet, but they are intrigued by the performance, security, and functionality of SQL Server.
